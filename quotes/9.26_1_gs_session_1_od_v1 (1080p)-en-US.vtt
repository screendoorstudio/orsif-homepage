5c245362-7a9c-4b3e-ae4f-b48f1f6fd297-0
00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.160
So for those of you on the East Coast of
America, good morning.

74d6b050-c96b-4956-8e07-e9437173471a-0
00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:07.235
For those of you on the West Coast and
very early morning and in Europe,

74d6b050-c96b-4956-8e07-e9437173471a-1
00:00:07.235 --> 00:00:08.040
good afternoon.

397810ed-05fd-4969-bcc9-fea45f111822-0
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.200
And if you're in Asia, well, good night.

81041a84-b563-4627-a16c-64480eb968d3-0
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.280
I'm going to be talking about scattered
radiation, understanding the basics.

5a222678-9477-4bda-ace4-23656e77207d-0
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.600
That's the title I've been given,
and my name is Andy Rogers.

2b21a0f9-b78a-467a-8bbc-9e1a69697ca5-0
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.426
I'm a lead interventional medical
physicist at Nottingham University

2b21a0f9-b78a-467a-8bbc-9e1a69697ca5-1
00:00:21.426 --> 00:00:24.920
Hospitals and the University of
Nottingham School of Medicine.

d261ec43-c0a9-4bf0-8ea0-f3eca171a433-0
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.088
So that's the title,
but what am I actually going to be

d261ec43-c0a9-4bf0-8ea0-f3eca171a433-1
00:00:28.088 --> 00:00:28.760
talking about?

c9b3b80a-5cc8-4e2f-9849-e5b133c6744d-0
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.320
So I'm going to be doing the physics.

25e132c8-8ac2-4800-8fc3-ed20fcda6c0f-0
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.200
Oh my goodness, I hear you all say.

2ca9f4fc-5dae-42e5-8b63-7441f89d96c6-0
00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.816
And then I'm going to be doing the
implication for the real world of that

2ca9f4fc-5dae-42e5-8b63-7441f89d96c6-1
00:00:37.816 --> 00:00:41.160
physics, which is a bit more,
I think what you want to know.

a9101179-cc04-455a-8ab1-97314faf10a2-0
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.320
But we've got to do the basics,
so bear with me, guys.

c795493f-7cf3-4c7a-ac76-b760d4dba881-0
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.200
So the physics,
it's about scattered radiation.

491e46c4-efcd-4cf5-a48d-97cee1cc15ba-0
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.680
And in physics we called scattered
radiation from X-rays Compton scatter.

00722faf-6346-4f8b-9914-09f307be9594-0
00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.840
So that's why I've put that name there
and come to scatter.

c154beb9-98b4-4a62-a088-63c662b4e43d-0
00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:59.320
What is it?

30948b31-c52c-4e3f-b6c0-0825a1f863ef-0
00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:05.532
This is what happens when a photon and
you call the photon the X-ray beam or the

30948b31-c52c-4e3f-b6c0-0825a1f863ef-1
00:01:05.532 --> 00:01:09.289
X-rays,
it hits an electron and is scattered off

30948b31-c52c-4e3f-b6c0-0825a1f863ef-2
00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.520
it.

c8901d82-b99a-467b-8f7c-6c1d483cc370-0
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.600
And what's an electron?

2b5a295f-8a38-4317-84b2-27a0a13c24a3-0
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.320
Well, for you,
the electron is part of your patient.

4dab7bde-2339-439a-a5be-bf8aad8aaba7-0
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.721
So we're really talking about the X-rays
coming out of your X-ray tube,

4dab7bde-2339-439a-a5be-bf8aad8aaba7-1
00:01:17.721 --> 00:01:20.240
smacking into the patient and bouncing
off.

3b430f60-717d-4327-99ac-ad043740fd08-0
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.160
So that's all very well.

8e1951e2-cc89-41f4-b882-1b86a2f44eee-0
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.094
And the diagram shows that the X-rays
come in, they've got a certain wavelength,

8e1951e2-cc89-41f4-b882-1b86a2f44eee-1
00:01:26.094 --> 00:01:28.280
and they go off with a different
wavelength.

b47a443c-3384-40b4-8706-4997fcec624e-0
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.880
And what that means in your term is a
slightly different energy.

e0637108-5ae7-4b2b-84fd-09f0fea4087b-0
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.920
So where do these scattered X-rays end up?

a4f415f2-8c36-44b7-a405-1ffe41ae7ea7-0
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.680
What's the physics of that?

16596a6c-cad4-42f4-92b7-701ca089d4af-0
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.436
Well,
the physics is something called the Klein

16596a6c-cad4-42f4-92b7-701ca089d4af-1
00:01:39.436 --> 00:01:40.200
Machiner formula.

d60b46de-d0b8-45a2-93ff-627366a887ca-0
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.080
There was no way I was going to put it in
the slide, way too complicated.

32c1c354-8e0d-44f8-939a-944a40f8238f-0
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.312
But essentially at the energies you guys
use in interventional radiology,

32c1c354-8e0d-44f8-939a-944a40f8238f-1
00:01:49.312 --> 00:01:53.295
if we've got any cardiologists in
interventional cardiology,

32c1c354-8e0d-44f8-939a-944a40f8238f-2
00:01:53.295 --> 00:01:56.560
you're looking at that brown peanut
shaped curve.

cbf4d5ed-08b0-4488-9358-48d0d0727722-0
00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.107
And what that's telling you is you're
slightly more likely to get forward

cbf4d5ed-08b0-4488-9358-48d0d0727722-1
00:02:02.107 --> 00:02:06.320
scatter than backward scatter and there's
less goes sideways.

7884ca2c-7ccc-4247-a11e-17cd340d7e6f-0
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.160
But that's the physics world and that
we're not really interested in that.

3a4a9b2a-b43a-4572-bf55-49b57b73aa86-0
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.760
We're interested in the real world.

4a590227-5dcc-43f5-8196-a02f2517d8b9-0
00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.720
What does this mean for staff Scatter?

353ff7c3-6ade-45f4-af0d-cc05a6914613-0
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.000
And rather counter intuitively,
it's completely the opposite.

402e36a6-6d50-40d7-a054-ccb42a29e092-0
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.120
And why is that?

b186a50c-72ed-4e72-9431-57f175c1524f-0
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.395
Well,
the physics is telling us what happens

b186a50c-72ed-4e72-9431-57f175c1524f-1
00:02:26.395 --> 00:02:29.440
when an X-ray hits an electron at a point
in space.

5768ccb1-227d-4925-b0c7-7a0deed77f4e-0
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.520
You've got a patient,
which is billions of points.

01ef2ac9-8c24-4a7a-bde0-f9e50fef48ff-0
00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.240
So what are the issues about that?

de7d5f3a-01f2-4bd3-bfc1-7e317fba4e15-0
00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.067
Well,
as your X-rays penetrate through the

de7d5f3a-01f2-4bd3-bfc1-7e317fba4e15-1
00:02:39.067 --> 00:02:41.621
patient,
there are actually less X-rays to be

de7d5f3a-01f2-4bd3-bfc1-7e317fba4e15-2
00:02:41.621 --> 00:02:43.120
scattered in the 1st place.

6c154232-2919-459d-ab3e-3629ff48b24f-0
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.320
So the deeper you go into the patient,
the less scatter there is.

3a567f8f-eb9d-4be7-b627-2e98c77ed5d1-0
00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.760
Now we said that in physics world,
forward scatter is the most likely.

70578964-a4f0-4465-bcbf-710a4a1848e4-0
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.640
However, because it's scattered forward,
it's then self attenuated by the patient.

7508e741-1022-4a7f-81a1-062afa7ddfff-0
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.194
So actually less is coming out in a
forward direction and because most of the

7508e741-1022-4a7f-81a1-062afa7ddfff-1
00:03:04.194 --> 00:03:08.922
backscatter happens very close to the
entrance surface of the patient,

7508e741-1022-4a7f-81a1-062afa7ddfff-2
00:03:08.922 --> 00:03:11.720
less of that is in is actually attenuated.

fdfc7c02-2de7-4012-aa92-2cb9cc5e9ff6-0
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.204
So what we get as a net result,
and I see Bella's scratching her head

fdfc7c02-2de7-4012-aa92-2cb9cc5e9ff6-1
00:03:17.204 --> 00:03:21.443
here is and you,
you may have come across these sorts of

fdfc7c02-2de7-4012-aa92-2cb9cc5e9ff6-2
00:03:21.443 --> 00:03:27.466
slides before we get these colour coded
contours of where the radiation is going

fdfc7c02-2de7-4012-aa92-2cb9cc5e9ff6-3
00:03:27.466 --> 00:03:29.920
in real life from a real patient.

6681b554-4a4a-4e7e-b3ac-5665ffbe015f-0
00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.960
And what you can see on the left is in
the AP direction.

dead7c76-ed5b-411f-88f5-6df663af6b92-0
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.400
Most of it's coming out at your midriff
and at your legs and ankles and feet.

7d07f07f-91ac-4fb6-bd37-1db0e314dd34-0
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.481
Now obviously you wear protection and
talks later in this session are going to

7d07f07f-91ac-4fb6-bd37-1db0e314dd34-1
00:03:42.481 --> 00:03:43.800
go into that in more detail.

510222f5-e11f-40c5-8a61-7e2bbcd1c37f-0
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:44.160
I'm not.

e083ab13-f772-4c69-ba80-6b1e54643505-0
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.480
I'm just doing the basics.

0ba1b771-e337-4b05-b400-d2b6b4003c99-0
00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.881
And if we look at the right hand side,
we've got the lateral direction,

0ba1b771-e337-4b05-b400-d2b6b4003c99-1
00:03:49.881 --> 00:03:50.760
the lateral beam.

482174d5-82de-4e95-baa4-d3ed9959b2f7-0
00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:56.120
And unfortunately for this operator there
stood right next to the tube,

482174d5-82de-4e95-baa4-d3ed9959b2f7-1
00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.920
which is absolutely the worst place to be.

384381f4-4c94-489c-8cc1-53ce71d4268a-0
00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:04.052
And what you can see is there's probably
about an order of magnitude difference in

384381f4-4c94-489c-8cc1-53ce71d4268a-1
00:04:04.052 --> 00:04:09.123
scatter dose rate between standing by the
tube and standing the other side by the

384381f4-4c94-489c-8cc1-53ce71d4268a-2
00:04:09.123 --> 00:04:09.680
detector.

61f62432-f3d9-4970-8962-5db1542cabbd-0
00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.920
Slightly counterintuitive.

454a83b1-f582-4a0f-8e63-c2a39ff368b5-0
00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.440
You think you're looking back at the tube.

061656af-83ac-4f66-8d28-2c576bb7e6e9-0
00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.360
Oh my goodness, it's aimed at me.

c31c8621-20a7-471a-82f4-93f0f6cf4ca4-0
00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.800
That is absolutely the best place to be.

583ef6cf-17ea-4557-a78e-426c81525c65-0
00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.120
But these are just generic numbers.

7d7f5755-4d23-4209-8247-e2c91621a6e5-0
00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.800
How can I find out the numbers for my
actual machine?

cb3e91c1-0a4b-49e9-8e9d-1dc3dc6ac96b-0
00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.593
Well, there is a way,
but I'm not actually going to recommend

cb3e91c1-0a4b-49e9-8e9d-1dc3dc6ac96b-1
00:04:26.593 --> 00:04:29.600
that to you because I think this is where
you work with medical physics.

069821a5-7cd6-4c66-a59f-25643befea3a-0
00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.335
But in the suppliers IFU,
and I've put that in inverted commas

069821a5-7cd6-4c66-a59f-25643befea3a-1
00:04:34.335 --> 00:04:37.280
because it stands for Instructions for
Use.

b683c72b-8d86-4285-bcd0-9f1c6c0df936-0
00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.120
It's often called the operator manuals.

31800ea4-99fa-498e-ba17-6b55c834b70f-0
00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.120
Towards the back somewhere,
they'll have scatter curves.

b26c37c4-c6d9-4515-aea5-56c4b08127f4-0
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.480
They'll tell you how they did the
experiment.

011c425d-1976-4d96-8591-971c269780ec-0
00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.653
They probably had some perspex in the
beam,

011c425d-1976-4d96-8591-971c269780ec-1
00:04:46.653 --> 00:04:49.320
and they measured the radiation all
around their kit.

91b943d3-b9ba-4a20-84f0-e3249a85b0d1-0
00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.000
And this is a Phillips one, I think,
from an Azurian interventional unit.

a5ec5e49-4286-40cf-9fee-d47ea184211f-0
00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.960
And what we can see is it's generally
scattering all over the place.

b38203ae-1b5c-4e13-846f-a8814e5b4a66-0
00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.840
There's the lateral,
but this is only for a machine with no

b38203ae-1b5c-4e13-846f-a8814e5b4a66-1
00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.480
one in position, no shielding.

fec75e9a-7bdd-4af7-86a8-14da5d5f74e2-0
00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.120
So it's not really like the real world.

02bc1edc-2bc4-43e8-9a67-5195b7fb6f39-0
00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.920
So we've got to actually think what's
hitting you guys and how do we know?

ed39489e-a8ed-4ea2-945a-decc23f2d89c-0
00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.800
The other thing we have to think about is
real life X-ray beams.

9176c2f4-a36c-44a3-8457-420b0aa2cc23-0
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.565
And what we find is these days with
modern interventional units,

9176c2f4-a36c-44a3-8457-420b0aa2cc23-1
00:05:22.565 --> 00:05:25.400
they have a lot of copper filtration in
the beam.

f46515f1-32e1-47d6-ad7e-6b91c004442e-0
00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:31.084
And what this curve is showing you from a,
a reference from Dave Sutton ET al back

f46515f1-32e1-47d6-ad7e-6b91c004442e-1
00:05:31.084 --> 00:05:35.609
in 2012 is that very roughly for the
heavily filtered fluoro beams,

f46515f1-32e1-47d6-ad7e-6b91c004442e-2
00:05:35.609 --> 00:05:41.067
you get about twice the scatter rate than
you do when you've got no copper in the

f46515f1-32e1-47d6-ad7e-6b91c004442e-3
00:05:41.067 --> 00:05:41.400
beam.

16e73f69-3166-4129-94a8-5b9f602944b9-0
00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.640
And Oh my goodness, I hear you will say.

c8bd8032-24d8-48ac-920f-efd875c7ecca-0
00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:48.445
But however, when you're using,
and this is per unit dose area products,

c8bd8032-24d8-48ac-920f-efd875c7ecca-1
00:05:48.445 --> 00:05:50.760
so per unit dose hitting the patient.

dd20a5cf-4ac0-4f45-83df-ee97fdf68504-0
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.029
But the good news is that when you use a
heavily filtered beam,

dd20a5cf-4ac0-4f45-83df-ee97fdf68504-1
00:05:56.029 --> 00:05:59.880
hopefully you're using less patient dose
anyway.

bb09a481-bc47-4116-b0b1-dd6f6a2f590f-0
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.560
So hopefully these two effects offset.

862e5f48-b539-417b-a063-e08486c6c598-0
00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.299
So I've tried to put this into numbers
when I'm doing sort of mental maths in my

862e5f48-b539-417b-a063-e08486c6c598-1
00:06:07.299 --> 00:06:07.560
head.

7aaa2d3a-08e0-4585-8361-2618ea4d29c7-0
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.200
What do I actually use?

0975a634-e84a-4248-9367-6d8357ff43b1-0
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:14.992
So for 0 copper filter,
the worst scatter in that red probably is

0975a634-e84a-4248-9367-6d8357ff43b1-1
00:06:14.992 --> 00:06:19.821
about 5 micro grey at a meter per unit
dose to the patient,

0975a634-e84a-4248-9367-6d8357ff43b1-2
00:06:19.821 --> 00:06:22.800
which is in grey centimetres squared.

025e4dae-6571-4e7f-a1b3-01532b1d8c57-0
00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:27.186
And when you get the heavily filtered
beam, we're up to about double that,

025e4dae-6571-4e7f-a1b3-01532b1d8c57-1
00:06:27.186 --> 00:06:27.960
just under 10.

f4c55e65-7a92-4619-813f-113e11b8f0b9-0
00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:33.280
So these are the ballpark figures I use
in my head to work out what the sort of

f4c55e65-7a92-4619-813f-113e11b8f0b9-1
00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:37.120
dose rates are round about,
where you guys and scrub nurses and

f4c55e65-7a92-4619-813f-113e11b8f0b9-2
00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.760
radiographer techs,
where they're standing.

dffd3c1a-3b47-495c-b6b4-253c83016c79-0
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.200
And this is how we do it.

faeae50b-0fb8-4eb6-9cf7-994445414ca3-0
00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:46.640
So in summary, the physics is great,
but what you need to know about is

faeae50b-0fb8-4eb6-9cf7-994445414ca3-1
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:47.120
reality.

c6fbc29e-8d2b-4893-9f12-0e60f4311132-0
00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.760
What happens in your lab,
scatter comes from your patient.

b9dacfe2-78d5-42b2-99b7-a5e0e92a8510-0
00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.640
In real life,
it mainly comes backwards and sideways.

b1b1ea0b-8a52-44cc-9a59-416a719338d5-0
00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.880
And just beware working on the patient
tube side.

8f7fafbf-62d1-4863-aa8c-3d8fbe5efa0b-0
00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.053
Now,
I'm sure you're going to have lots of

8f7fafbf-62d1-4863-aa8c-3d8fbe5efa0b-1
00:07:00.053 --> 00:07:00.920
questions at the end.

4c4b2e52-ec28-413d-9089-8470cdf14c20-0
00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.160
There's AQ and A at the end of this
session.

0978e430-af0e-4e83-9d22-22353c522ca7-0
00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:08.518
So I look forward to meeting you all in
reality and you'll see my ugly face

0978e430-af0e-4e83-9d22-22353c522ca7-1
00:07:08.518 --> 00:07:09.120
properly.

eb473887-3f92-4ec4-874c-273487d1b33e-0
00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:10.240
Thank you very much.

5f3fe209-0a24-4485-a2dc-c826070ff976-0
00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.160
Hello, I'm Patrick Muck.

be10199f-7ca4-4f2c-a901-20580c5904e1-0
00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:18.259
I'm the Chief of Vascular Surgery,
the program Director of vascular Surgery

be10199f-7ca4-4f2c-a901-20580c5904e1-1
00:07:18.259 --> 00:07:21.280
at Trihealth Good Samaritan Hospital in
Cincinnati, OH.

bba04c48-8b5c-45c1-beaf-c665dde69e27-0
00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:26.403
Today I'm fortunate to go over the topic
access techniques and how they impact

bba04c48-8b5c-45c1-beaf-c665dde69e27-1
00:07:26.403 --> 00:07:28.520
radiation exposure and our practice.

eaf0cab6-65a0-4963-8ead-b46bde9e4094-0
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.280
Those are my disclosures.

cda4f182-4328-4ccf-8645-1c894a6fdaca-0
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:35.832
Being a vascular surgeon, you know,
often times we do some large Thraco

cda4f182-4328-4ccf-8645-1c894a6fdaca-1
00:07:35.832 --> 00:07:41.564
abdominal aneurysm repairs such as this
and those situations that you can see how

cda4f182-4328-4ccf-8645-1c894a6fdaca-2
00:07:41.564 --> 00:07:44.920
we typically dress without any lead
protection.

25faad75-da0c-40a4-b29e-8091386766a0-0
00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.495
But the reality is,
is that with all the technology,

25faad75-da0c-40a4-b29e-8091386766a0-1
00:07:48.495 --> 00:07:52.992
there's less and less open surgery,
more and more endovascular and more and

25faad75-da0c-40a4-b29e-8091386766a0-2
00:07:52.992 --> 00:07:53.880
more radiation.

3f4ac508-bc95-4631-b875-3e60938f816a-0
00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:59.024
We know that personal lead shielding
started somewhere around 1928,

3f4ac508-bc95-4631-b875-3e60938f816a-1
00:07:59.024 --> 00:08:00.600
so almost a century ago.

5cc96e5c-d0e3-4962-9f54-f50231ed1952-0
00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:05.195
And you can see here with, with Emily,
our integrated 5th year resident,

5cc96e5c-d0e3-4962-9f54-f50231ed1952-1
00:08:05.195 --> 00:08:10.168
that there's really sometimes difficult,
it's difficult to provide appropriate

5cc96e5c-d0e3-4962-9f54-f50231ed1952-2
00:08:10.168 --> 00:08:13.883
radiation protection when you're doing
cases such as this,

5cc96e5c-d0e3-4962-9f54-f50231ed1952-3
00:08:13.883 --> 00:08:15.519
as I'm going to highlight.

370d4109-86fb-4863-80c0-918e1353fc41-0
00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:19.640
And as a vascular surgeon, you know,
we just don't go femoral or radio.

d68cc59d-c9ef-457c-bc59-e74c05c55b2c-0
00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:21.520
We go radio brachial.

57436633-7932-445b-9b49-483e9a11ad03-0
00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:23.440
We do crowded access for tea cars.

193404e8-6933-4b85-9f80-eb3b84a2cec3-0
00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:29.684
We do femoral papatito approaches for PE
and DVT and we do pedal approaches as

193404e8-6933-4b85-9f80-eb3b84a2cec3-1
00:08:29.684 --> 00:08:30.080
well.

f727cea2-4094-4ad5-82b2-aed128f7c863-0
00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:33.313
So as you can imagine,
this is what I need to be wearing day in

f727cea2-4094-4ad5-82b2-aed128f7c863-1
00:08:33.313 --> 00:08:33.920
and day out.

801165ea-e505-4cb2-9c5d-f71e6232752e-0
00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:38.360
And there's definitely room for
improvement in 2025.

4232fa93-5cfa-4606-b7d4-282661dd06e6-0
00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:45.873
So I think by now we all know that the
there's failures of standard lead aprons,

4232fa93-5cfa-4606-b7d4-282661dd06e6-1
00:08:45.873 --> 00:08:49.520
it only covers about 60 to 70% of the
body.

2d430de2-a149-496b-b884-2582deb51ff1-0
00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:54.854
And not to mention it can weigh a lot,
up to 24 lbs and cause significant

2d430de2-a149-496b-b884-2582deb51ff1-1
00:08:54.854 --> 00:08:56.080
orthopaedic issues.

3e3fe0a9-559f-4441-bc78-7d9f5c18f4bc-0
00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:58.800
So I would argue that there's room for
improvement.

e3cf8207-af10-4ef0-8d08-ddaa45ef0277-0
00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:02.641
The problem with radiation exposure is
it's hidden, you know,

e3cf8207-af10-4ef0-8d08-ddaa45ef0277-1
00:09:02.641 --> 00:09:06.558
from left to right you can see somebody
the, the dangers of working in a,

e3cf8207-af10-4ef0-8d08-ddaa45ef0277-2
00:09:06.558 --> 00:09:08.040
in a being a crane operator.

0236eb76-f8bc-48d7-a359-b125c83e0d2c-0
00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:11.964
If you're Mike Tyson and have a pet tiger
like this,

0236eb76-f8bc-48d7-a359-b125c83e0d2c-1
00:09:11.964 --> 00:09:16.588
obviously there's risk to that if you
skydive there, the third one,

0236eb76-f8bc-48d7-a359-b125c83e0d2c-2
00:09:16.588 --> 00:09:20.260
or if you're crazy enough to ride a bike
along a dam,

0236eb76-f8bc-48d7-a359-b125c83e0d2c-3
00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:24.000
those are obvious dangers that are right
in your face.

a37bfe14-195f-4084-8602-4edd3d0dcfc7-0
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.720
But radiation exposure is hidden.

39258653-103c-472a-af2d-db35c6096c1b-0
00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:30.486
And it's pretty obvious that, you know,
if you don't want a sunburn or radiation

39258653-103c-472a-af2d-db35c6096c1b-1
00:09:30.486 --> 00:09:32.463
injury,
then you should really not go out into

39258653-103c-472a-af2d-db35c6096c1b-2
00:09:32.463 --> 00:09:32.800
the sun.

b3a15807-b98e-449c-9881-d54c966d2f36-0
00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:36.949
And we know it causes cataracts,
ortho orthopedic injuries,

b3a15807-b98e-449c-9881-d54c966d2f36-1
00:09:36.949 --> 00:09:40.200
stochastic effects of skin changes and
cancer.

760c7cdc-548e-451a-8ec3-55ca462a7e25-0
00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:44.492
And so I really think it's important that
we protect ourselves just as much as we

760c7cdc-548e-451a-8ec3-55ca462a7e25-1
00:09:44.492 --> 00:09:45.520
protect our patients.

2f18aeba-34b8-44b7-84da-a9eb47984fd8-0
00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:49.580
As mentioned, more and more is open,
less and excuse me,

2f18aeba-34b8-44b7-84da-a9eb47984fd8-1
00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:52.880
more and more is endovascular and less
and less is open.

bf6f74f0-65a4-4d01-bce5-650f0b4f3404-0
00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:57.811
And here's data from 2019 showing the
explosion of endovascular aneurysm repair

bf6f74f0-65a4-4d01-bce5-650f0b4f3404-1
00:09:57.811 --> 00:10:00.040
replace an open surgery for aneurysms.

bdae4e9e-f9e1-44b9-b2a5-2064a3592c36-0
00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:01.720
It's not just aneurysms.

bff41da7-62a8-4d3f-853b-be493238bad6-0
00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:06.156
If you look at peripheral arterial
disease from 2011 to 2016, again,

bff41da7-62a8-4d3f-853b-be493238bad6-1
00:10:06.156 --> 00:10:09.563
you see more and more endo,
more and more radiation,

bff41da7-62a8-4d3f-853b-be493238bad6-2
00:10:09.563 --> 00:10:12.200
less and less open surgery in particular.

aea746ef-7a05-4b65-bb73-6ced420e0564-0
00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:16.790
There's also been an explosion in the
infrapopathile growth and with that,

aea746ef-7a05-4b65-bb73-6ced420e0564-1
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:20.280
more radiation as we do more and more
endovascular work.

cb94ad46-41f2-4ee0-970a-cfbe48ca277c-0
00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:24.560
I literally just broke my patients just
being moved out of the hybrid room.

1339374d-b23e-4eac-9a03-f1b0276a6029-0
00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:30.586
I just got done doing a TCAR and without
a doubt TCAR is continuing to increase in

1339374d-b23e-4eac-9a03-f1b0276a6029-1
00:10:30.586 --> 00:10:31.240
adoption.

948bb355-31c0-4d73-865a-dd0cf1087589-0
00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:34.247
With that,
you're right next to the radiation source

948bb355-31c0-4d73-865a-dd0cf1087589-1
00:10:34.247 --> 00:10:35.440
in the image intensifier.

ebd51812-4ec2-49ca-9371-dfc45d11ba9e-0
00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:39.939
And so these various access points are a
real problem for the operator,

ebd51812-4ec2-49ca-9371-dfc45d11ba9e-1
00:10:39.939 --> 00:10:44.525
but not only the operator at the RN and
the RT and the anesthesiologist in the

ebd51812-4ec2-49ca-9371-dfc45d11ba9e-2
00:10:44.525 --> 00:10:45.280
room as well.

06d95891-5ae6-4867-b8e8-f5e425b806b4-0
00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:48.600
So we need to to take this seriously here.

e3faddcf-6bd8-4808-af2e-d207a67d02f1-0
00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:52.964
You can see, you know,
when here we have Emily doing a dialysis

e3faddcf-6bd8-4808-af2e-d207a67d02f1-1
00:10:52.964 --> 00:10:57.943
procedure here we're doing a filter
retrieval here we're doing some more

e3faddcf-6bd8-4808-af2e-d207a67d02f1-2
00:10:57.943 --> 00:11:03.400
endovascular work in the picture in the
middle here really depicts the problem.

a079ad3a-f5c3-47fe-8f7a-060fa7b09028-0
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.465
Whatever your access point is,
you have radiation coming up and scatter

a079ad3a-f5c3-47fe-8f7a-060fa7b09028-1
00:11:08.465 --> 00:11:13.303
as egg medical will tell you what their,
what their slogan scatter absolutely

a079ad3a-f5c3-47fe-8f7a-060fa7b09028-2
00:11:13.303 --> 00:11:13.800
matters.

685abac3-7ebf-49e5-a644-653f6bc13b8a-0
00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:18.280
You know,
we're also doing more and more physician

685abac3-7ebf-49e5-a644-653f6bc13b8a-1
00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:21.160
modified and endograph cases here to the
to the left.

389cbb23-4625-43cb-9a51-2a6cb9fc1965-0
00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.480
You can see what we're doing here in the
middle, we have our TAMBI.

b11b5c33-8c15-49b7-a03e-a8135471da3c-0
00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.520
Here is the upper extremity.

6c66d29a-e194-4201-b0a5-3ae7dc9b70d6-0
00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:30.101
Here's the femoral axis for a TMB
procedure we're doing in all access

6c66d29a-e194-4201-b0a5-3ae7dc9b70d6-1
00:11:30.101 --> 00:11:30.560
points.

e8b0540e-e265-4f65-8a7a-ad7ff75be57b-0
00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:31.840
And here we're going through the brachial.

aabb52b7-5c1a-49d4-958f-87a920068b26-0
00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:35.065
By the way,
the shield's not low enough and and so

aabb52b7-5c1a-49d4-958f-87a920068b26-1
00:11:35.065 --> 00:11:38.480
radiation is an absolute problem in these
situations.

b9dde915-2e8a-4ced-83a0-61fff6f65fdc-0
00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:43.284
As I mentioned,
just got done doing a TCAR and for those

b9dde915-2e8a-4ced-83a0-61fff6f65fdc-1
00:11:43.284 --> 00:11:47.763
of you you're not familiar with it,
TCARS where you do a small incision in

b9dde915-2e8a-4ced-83a0-61fff6f65fdc-2
00:11:47.763 --> 00:11:52.183
the neck do access and we're able to
induce flow reversal for our crowded

b9dde915-2e8a-4ced-83a0-61fff6f65fdc-3
00:11:52.183 --> 00:11:52.840
stent here.

512a97f9-3b75-4f60-be56-a7e1df799d8d-0
00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:57.520
But you're right next to the eye,
eye and the radiation absolutely matters.

ff66aea5-0c23-42ca-84a4-b81c62697c4e-0
00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:00.520
Your head and neck are right next to the
image intensifier.

4daa6377-65e4-4cea-a45d-c04428557c33-0
00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:04.280
Here's a case I did not too long ago,
a left sided lesion.

7ef1d5b4-e547-4d17-a5c4-ace438a45d68-0
00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:08.072
Here you can see our Wheatlander
retractors as we're obtaining exposure

7ef1d5b4-e547-4d17-a5c4-ace438a45d68-1
00:12:08.072 --> 00:12:09.800
through our cut down for the T car.

88e9bb03-f095-4da4-8e17-0bceab40513b-0
00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:14.295
And here you can see Emily,
our integrated resident doesn't know how

88e9bb03-f095-4da4-8e17-0bceab40513b-1
00:12:14.295 --> 00:12:16.960
to get a shield on the left side of the
table here.

fc23c5b3-eb3a-4507-a88e-4003a3d78d09-0
00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:22.720
And so you know these various access
points are a real health problem for us.

87e0ee10-d349-4cf0-984c-ff30c8551262-0
00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.015
So Tcars a problem,
lower extremity work with tibial and

87e0ee10-d349-4cf0-984c-ff30c8551262-1
00:12:27.015 --> 00:12:31.946
pedal accesses are a problem,
IVC problems, dialysis procedures, PES,

87e0ee10-d349-4cf0-984c-ff30c8551262-2
00:12:31.946 --> 00:12:35.680
and of course venous stenting continues
to increase.

cf3d7cbc-e421-4398-a1c1-5b6b1f33cf96-0
00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:38.670
So as I'm now 55 years old,
I've been doing the,

cf3d7cbc-e421-4398-a1c1-5b6b1f33cf96-1
00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:41.600
the program directorship for the last 18
years.

d27ed868-4d1b-432c-89cf-b1cb8b43f11d-0
00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:47.092
I feel like it's my responsibility,
my generation to advocate for safer labs,

d27ed868-4d1b-432c-89cf-b1cb8b43f11d-1
00:12:47.092 --> 00:12:51.682
better tools and invest in long term,
long term health of our staff and

d27ed868-4d1b-432c-89cf-b1cb8b43f11d-2
00:12:51.682 --> 00:12:52.320
ourselves.

ef48d02a-6545-4048-8183-9b5473ccdad7-0
00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:54.240
And it's just not the physician.

f8bc0341-e5ff-4084-afea-74c55101fe5a-0
00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:55.640
What about our team members?

8aaa2161-5906-405d-a1d9-4999f0ad72b6-0
00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:59.240
I think it's a, a moral imperative for us.

a2ae3af9-bead-49fd-ba15-6fe9bbae7a42-0
00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:02.114
You know,
I may do 6 to 15 cases a week as a

a2ae3af9-bead-49fd-ba15-6fe9bbae7a42-1
00:13:02.114 --> 00:13:03.200
vascular surgeon.

99905dad-8351-4538-93f9-00ee71f7913c-0
00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:07.242
Well, we've got 6 vascular surgeons,
3 IRI kind of joked that sometimes in

99905dad-8351-4538-93f9-00ee71f7913c-1
00:13:07.242 --> 00:13:10.153
neurosurgeons,
I'm not certain they really care about

99905dad-8351-4538-93f9-00ee71f7913c-2
00:13:10.153 --> 00:13:12.040
folks, but that's of course a joke.

64d8d0af-500f-4471-9820-b52de5902de8-0
00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:17.490
But All in all,
our RTS and RNS are doing 40 to 60 cases

64d8d0af-500f-4471-9820-b52de5902de8-1
00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:20.240
a week from various access points.

3427a1bc-4c7e-47d0-a7d2-fe6f109543bb-0
00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:25.400
And so personal protection is a problem
here at Good Samaritan, unfortunately.

6ca7ce4e-03f1-4dce-a639-d91825733ee5-0
00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:31.086
Unfortunately, we have a, a,
an RT who was just diagnosed with a left

6ca7ce4e-03f1-4dce-a639-d91825733ee5-1
00:13:31.086 --> 00:13:32.120
eye cataract.

010a39e6-1f27-44d7-884a-832d25a9aab7-0
00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:35.120
Obviously,
the radiation sources closer to the left.

867fc36f-e450-46d9-9eed-1247a1875bd6-0
00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:40.005
And a good buddy of mine had a skin
lesion on his ear that was radiation

867fc36f-e450-46d9-9eed-1247a1875bd6-1
00:13:40.005 --> 00:13:40.480
induced.

820d28b2-3172-43ae-8c4a-75cc30b3b256-0
00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:44.512
So I think there's got to be a better way
because without a doubt,

820d28b2-3172-43ae-8c4a-75cc30b3b256-1
00:13:44.512 --> 00:13:48.320
these various access points don't allow
for appropriate protection.

8e21c002-1086-403d-a6dc-0145ad3edc62-0
00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:50.040
So what's changed?

4d683635-6a8a-4c6d-b7ed-78ea7e8c6bfb-0
00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:53.814
Barrier protection or,
or or shielding here locally,

4d683635-6a8a-4c6d-b7ed-78ea7e8c6bfb-1
00:13:53.814 --> 00:13:57.830
as I mentioned,
egg medical recently was introduced into

4d683635-6a8a-4c6d-b7ed-78ea7e8c6bfb-2
00:13:57.830 --> 00:13:59.240
the Christ Hospital.

2b1623e3-a37c-4885-ba6a-c7105fcecf0d-0
00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:02.258
You all know this gentleman,
Doctor Dean Kiriakis,

2b1623e3-a37c-4885-ba6a-c7105fcecf0d-1
00:14:02.258 --> 00:14:05.037
not only known here in the city or in the
country,

2b1623e3-a37c-4885-ba6a-c7105fcecf0d-2
00:14:05.037 --> 00:14:08.851
but throughout the world for his
incredible work as an interventional

2b1623e3-a37c-4885-ba6a-c7105fcecf0d-3
00:14:08.851 --> 00:14:09.560
cardiologist.

ba943f37-bb2f-4c76-8371-7b24418697a8-0
00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:15.243
And he really, you know this,
this interview on Channel 5 here locally

ba943f37-bb2f-4c76-8371-7b24418697a8-1
00:14:15.243 --> 00:14:20.625
advocated the benefits of the egg medical
system and with the tag phrase,

ba943f37-bb2f-4c76-8371-7b24418697a8-2
00:14:20.625 --> 00:14:22.080
the scatter matters.

a83754ff-1511-4905-86bb-590557c5a74b-0
00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:27.275
And if you're not familiar with it,
this is really enhanced radiation barrier

a83754ff-1511-4905-86bb-590557c5a74b-1
00:14:27.275 --> 00:14:31.670
protection that is in does an incredible
job for cardiology work,

a83754ff-1511-4905-86bb-590557c5a74b-2
00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:36.000
peripheral work as well as our with our
neurosurgery colleagues.

c3b2200e-ffc4-41fc-9c84-62ae31111170-0
00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:42.621
There's also another company Rampart,
by now I'm certain you're familiar with

c3b2200e-ffc4-41fc-9c84-62ae31111170-1
00:14:42.621 --> 00:14:45.114
it,
but they have also enhanced barrier

c3b2200e-ffc4-41fc-9c84-62ae31111170-2
00:14:45.114 --> 00:14:45.800
protection.

871955f6-2cd6-483c-89d9-e3334cac56bd-0
00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:49.343
What I like about their system is I call
these mud flaps,

871955f6-2cd6-483c-89d9-e3334cac56bd-1
00:14:49.343 --> 00:14:53.160
it's a trifold or or three different
Shields that you can utilize.

b3af541a-67a5-4e63-97c5-a0e43a180549-0
00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:56.745
And with that,
as I'll show you here in a second,

b3af541a-67a5-4e63-97c5-a0e43a180549-1
00:14:56.745 --> 00:15:01.405
they have lead barriers that come down
and kind of can can wrap around your

b3af541a-67a5-4e63-97c5-a0e43a180549-2
00:15:01.405 --> 00:15:03.920
access points and help with this scatter.

fc8667a7-8034-44fc-821c-807cda4f9f36-0
00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:07.360
And this is what we recently start
utilizing for our procedures.

95cb9525-848c-4c34-9867-e1104f0eb527-0
00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:12.689
They have that coupled with the really
solid lead Shields on the side of the

95cb9525-848c-4c34-9867-e1104f0eb527-1
00:15:12.689 --> 00:15:13.280
patients.

34a2c43c-82b7-42cc-8a5f-aa5b1a3015dd-0
00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:18.063
And so this is really,
really refreshing for us and my partners

34a2c43c-82b7-42cc-8a5f-aa5b1a3015dd-1
00:15:18.063 --> 00:15:22.002
here with them,
you can often times obviate the need for

34a2c43c-82b7-42cc-8a5f-aa5b1a3015dd-2
00:15:22.002 --> 00:15:24.560
heavy lead, lead aprons all together.

0bab8118-4e2b-4a50-b3a8-c7198f7b3508-0
00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:27.720
Here's their defender system,
here's the Guardian system.

bf30b00a-4d6b-4ee5-807b-43d1b727f3ef-0
00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:33.699
And here again is is just the defender
and your ability to, as they say,

bf30b00a-4d6b-4ee5-807b-43d1b727f3ef-1
00:15:33.699 --> 00:15:35.840
shed the lead just like egg.

68c02da1-b1f5-40d2-8d39-1134ba1ce798-0
00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:40.220
There's data out there purporting that
with the Rampart system,

68c02da1-b1f5-40d2-8d39-1134ba1ce798-1
00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:45.560
you have 20 times less radiation than the
traditional lead shield and aprons.

2bc95c91-c4b3-43df-bee7-99b2503c2b4f-0
00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:50.639
And I cannot emphasize enough how
important this is for physicians, techs,

2bc95c91-c4b3-43df-bee7-99b2503c2b4f-1
00:15:50.639 --> 00:15:52.400
nurses in the entire room.

fcba5262-a70d-4745-88ea-283e371adc4a-0
00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:55.210
And here's some data,
the red and the blue,

fcba5262-a70d-4745-88ea-283e371adc4a-1
00:15:55.210 --> 00:16:00.191
you can see a unbelievable drop in the in
the radiation exposure with Rampart

fcba5262-a70d-4745-88ea-283e371adc4a-2
00:16:00.191 --> 00:16:03.960
compared to the traditional lead apron
here in Cincinnati.

ebca77c8-eda1-473a-be85-84d14e895f81-0
00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:05.920
I'd like to say that the future is now.

58f4693c-b608-4ea8-95c1-ba2cc7b40f4b-0
00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:09.775
You know, if you're in Japan,
they've got drones kind of directing

58f4693c-b608-4ea8-95c1-ba2cc7b40f4b-1
00:16:09.775 --> 00:16:14.388
traffic in real time to to minimize your
time out of a concert when I'm visiting

58f4693c-b608-4ea8-95c1-ba2cc7b40f4b-2
00:16:14.388 --> 00:16:16.040
my daughter in San Francisco.

e99d5065-ac56-4636-ac30-2a38b5eb522f-0
00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:17.320
Here's a way MO.

d993f16c-0ac5-4020-97a0-94dcf7d67beb-0
00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:20.321
And so we got with the times earlier this
year,

d993f16c-0ac5-4020-97a0-94dcf7d67beb-1
00:16:20.321 --> 00:16:22.240
we start utilizing the defender system.

0a4e7c8a-9d30-4dc8-b4e4-14a9dbee7fcb-0
00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:28.640
Here's our now attending down in Stuart,
FL Jake Shapiro along with Kathy doing a

0a4e7c8a-9d30-4dc8-b4e4-14a9dbee7fcb-1
00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:31.440
symplavium procedure without any lead.

a10baf41-020a-473a-9f0b-532421cd175d-0
00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:33.000
So it's really exciting.

008e9b66-3c42-462e-ae0e-5c0c9a0df91a-0
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.640
I did this about two weeks ago.

38188ec3-0140-4e05-9d3b-3e78f622194f-0
00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.953
Technically Emily here she is positioning
the guardian and again it's got the three

38188ec3-0140-4e05-9d3b-3e78f622194f-1
00:16:39.953 --> 00:16:41.840
Shields as well as the mudflaps.

e9e062ed-1301-4e6a-a985-f5e08bd45526-0
00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:47.832
And with an EVAR, she received only 0.
2 milligrams, which to me is, is,

e9e062ed-1301-4e6a-a985-f5e08bd45526-1
00:16:47.832 --> 00:16:48.920
is phenomenal.

87a6f407-faef-43d7-acdb-c7c6b361fa74-0
00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:51.560
And not only that, here's Cody,
our other fellow.

793aee07-dbda-48b5-8011-2e79a09dd84a-0
00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:53.480
It's total room protection.

d59bced0-e123-474a-b81f-71fb732b14af-0
00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:57.272
You know,
if you take a flight from New York to San

d59bced0-e123-474a-b81f-71fb732b14af-1
00:16:57.272 --> 00:17:00.600
Francisco,
you get about two to 2 1/2 Miller rims.

16fe7671-302b-4430-bb09-c8a5e0325415-0
00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:04.858
She can do 10 EVARS and still get less
radiation exposure than a

16fe7671-302b-4430-bb09-c8a5e0325415-1
00:17:04.858 --> 00:17:06.960
transcontinental flight like that.

cb8b51a4-4aed-4240-8b94-e94aacf26b24-0
00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:10.760
And obviously, you know, I,
I say the word mudflaps.

641b4669-d884-4ae0-b79e-408ade7791c3-0
00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:14.412
I'm trying to just highlight how I think
of it or how I explain it to patients,

641b4669-d884-4ae0-b79e-408ade7791c3-1
00:17:14.412 --> 00:17:15.280
but just invention.

0a9e439a-2545-4262-a46c-27dd583b3cfb-0
00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:18.040
This is a lead shield hanging off the
table here.

f4f1b57f-08f8-404f-9883-b7b5ca0fbc69-0
00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:23.080
So it really minimizes it on the
borderline, eliminates it really.

4af4d7bd-bc4c-499c-a027-230e6cc8b753-0
00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:27.720
And so here's a a fenestrated
endovascular aneurysm repair.

ec183665-14ff-461c-8e2c-dcfc57cafa0b-0
00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:28.760
Here's the Guardian.

d3f7790a-5108-460a-928c-fa3d16621a32-0
00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:34.880
Joey, our middle tech here, you know,
did his research with Rampart and

d3f7790a-5108-460a-928c-fa3d16621a32-1
00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:37.360
realized he does not need lead.

36a60de4-c424-4c03-9c13-e6f0bca6fec3-0
00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:40.153
Personally,
I'm just doing a little bit more research

36a60de4-c424-4c03-9c13-e6f0bca6fec3-1
00:17:40.153 --> 00:17:41.040
before we get there.

32030220-fc9a-443b-a4f6-165532364972-0
00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:45.903
But I do envision here in the near future,
we're going to have not enough data

32030220-fc9a-443b-a4f6-165532364972-1
00:17:45.903 --> 00:17:49.520
accrued that's going to show that in fact
we can shed the lead.

f3e7a519-8a3e-408b-9b75-470f4da021aa-0
00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:53.547
And mind you,
this is a traditional case that we did

f3e7a519-8a3e-408b-9b75-470f4da021aa-1
00:17:53.547 --> 00:17:56.410
last Tuesday,
just a standard bilateral iliac,

f3e7a519-8a3e-408b-9b75-470f4da021aa-2
00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:57.079
a stenting.

daf66e52-0985-4b1b-a027-efdce0b71e3e-0
00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:00.840
We had three milligrams with a
traditional one lead shield.

a35172aa-5afb-4fda-9676-13b4bb549bcb-0
00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:05.800
So that's 15 more times exposure than the
E bar that Emily did.

1f8c9e4f-3074-437e-90c5-8420190eb673-0
00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:08.360
And so we're going to continue to accrue
data.

eb8a62a6-1afb-464b-aef8-09d78fa8a994-0
00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:12.120
We are super excited these various access
points.

e53926cf-c794-4d14-a61d-10ef95f939d3-0
00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:15.400
That's where this this guardian is so
incredible.

11ba6aee-b1cf-4446-b631-69800811601e-0
00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:20.116
We can bring it up for radio,
we can bring it up for brachial, femoral,

11ba6aee-b1cf-4446-b631-69800811601e-1
00:18:20.116 --> 00:18:20.640
Papatil.

af3beed1-0694-483a-b926-59386f157b97-0
00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:25.581
We can do it for jugular,
for filter retrievals and then pedal as

af3beed1-0694-483a-b926-59386f157b97-1
00:18:25.581 --> 00:18:25.920
well.

1e3deef4-9c0d-4f6f-bc8c-14132acc00d9-0
00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:32.445
And so we're really excited and I can't
thank the Rampart team enough for

1e3deef4-9c0d-4f6f-bc8c-14132acc00d9-1
00:18:32.445 --> 00:18:36.640
directing us in the right direction for
radiation mitigation.

62ca5978-318f-40b3-8419-170103be3d2a-0
00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:40.716
So until then,
thanks again for being allowing me to be

62ca5978-318f-40b3-8419-170103be3d2a-1
00:18:40.716 --> 00:18:42.080
part of this meeting.

0ecb628f-4bd0-4d3e-92b4-845f5a5b98b4-0
00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:44.120
Let's all keep working hard.

64fe265c-b838-4db9-aa71-2d44e27ca1f3-0
00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:48.560
Let's keep accruing data, scatter matters,
and let's shed the lead.

0cff947c-1395-4b60-bd46-b4ce8d8b6221-0
00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:50.000
So thank you so much.

dd029942-1473-4ae4-bc70-67dedd1d0781-0
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.520
I appreciate this invitation.

01cbe554-925a-4e1f-85b2-a2a78c389495-0
00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:56.501
This is a incredible symposium that is
ultra important to all of our team

01cbe554-925a-4e1f-85b2-a2a78c389495-1
00:18:56.501 --> 00:18:57.040
members.

a894d5f5-0fe7-49d5-938d-821a6e773738-0
00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:58.320
Thank you so much.

0b033dc0-5ce8-4633-90cb-71b0da736620-0
00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:02.440
Hello, my name is Doctor Bill Gray.

5cf10e9f-6fd1-4c66-abca-b64a5892ba7e-0
00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:05.743
I'm the system chief of cardiovascular
division at Mainline Health just outside

5cf10e9f-6fd1-4c66-abca-b64a5892ba7e-1
00:19:05.743 --> 00:19:06.280
Philadelphia.

fe82163c-3a66-484e-8be5-a590279543b0-0
00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:09.400
I'm professor of medicine at Thomas
Jefferson University.

c919b6be-5033-4921-94a9-187f0526c5ee-0
00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:14.583
Today we're going to be talking about
2025 advances in imaging and scatter

c919b6be-5033-4921-94a9-187f0526c5ee-1
00:19:14.583 --> 00:19:17.590
radiation,
scatter radiation reducing technologies

c919b6be-5033-4921-94a9-187f0526c5ee-2
00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:19.360
for safe, safer interventions.

11a8744b-99de-468e-83f7-02e76a7b4a90-0
00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:24.320
Here are my disclosures.

ef4e8662-9b3f-48c7-86d0-7d04f55ac58c-0
00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:27.753
I am a consultant to Radioaction,
one of the systems that we'll be seeing

ef4e8662-9b3f-48c7-86d0-7d04f55ac58c-1
00:19:27.753 --> 00:19:28.960
we'll be discussing today.

7b2faf16-1ef2-4313-9c80-008a5ae1bd10-0
00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:34.901
So my brother-in-law in arms,
Kenny Rosenfeld had I thought a very

7b2faf16-1ef2-4313-9c80-008a5ae1bd10-1
00:19:34.901 --> 00:19:39.418
poignant quote that from a practical
moral and risk mitigation perspective,

7b2faf16-1ef2-4313-9c80-008a5ae1bd10-2
00:19:39.418 --> 00:19:44.232
every institution performing fluoroscopic
procedures with X-ray equipment should

7b2faf16-1ef2-4313-9c80-008a5ae1bd10-3
00:19:44.232 --> 00:19:47.560
equip labs with enhanced radiation
shielding solutions.

cdc8db62-3ce2-43b0-854b-fa4249510b68-0
00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:53.016
And really that's what this whole talk is
about and and the whole field which is

cdc8db62-3ce2-43b0-854b-fa4249510b68-1
00:19:53.016 --> 00:19:55.240
rapidly developing is aims to do.

4db7a35f-2d21-41c9-bc43-5ad2ab748a69-0
00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:00.680
So let's just set the stage a little bit
about radiation.

d7f9c1ac-0b38-4316-932b-6d9f65ac7d6d-0
00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:04.545
We don't talk enough about this in our
day-to-day lives,

d7f9c1ac-0b38-4316-932b-6d9f65ac7d6d-1
00:20:04.545 --> 00:20:08.360
but there's been lots of science around
radiation and Cath labs.

c467818e-38dd-4e85-9432-4c38e17a86c9-0
00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:14.188
And if we look at the various positions
and roles within the Cath lab on the

c467818e-38dd-4e85-9432-4c38e17a86c9-1
00:20:14.188 --> 00:20:19.032
right hand side here,
you can see that at the head of the table

c467818e-38dd-4e85-9432-4c38e17a86c9-2
00:20:19.032 --> 00:20:23.120
#1 and #2 are the echo or implanting an
EP physician.

1568fb0e-19e4-4582-a1c8-c1af93f1f7de-0
00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:29.174
Or the anesthesiologist or anybody doing
jugular access procedures #3 would be the

1568fb0e-19e4-4582-a1c8-c1af93f1f7de-1
00:20:29.174 --> 00:20:32.722
EP assistant,
which would be on the other side of the

1568fb0e-19e4-4582-a1c8-c1af93f1f7de-2
00:20:32.722 --> 00:20:37.520
table where typically dual radiation
protection is not available in most

1568fb0e-19e4-4582-a1c8-c1af93f1f7de-3
00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:38.440
systems today.

1ab1f44e-dbbf-44c4-b79e-59bf0b1e9489-0
00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:44.939
The operator in the radiology tech or the
assistant would be then in the primary

1ab1f44e-dbbf-44c4-b79e-59bf0b1e9489-1
00:20:44.939 --> 00:20:48.072
position,
4:00 and 5:00 and then the circulating

1ab1f44e-dbbf-44c4-b79e-59bf0b1e9489-2
00:20:48.072 --> 00:20:49.159
nurse number six.

76abda73-ff56-4a9d-b27f-e3e1b0ba7f2b-0
00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:54.857
Now remember while we are all as
physicians and operators closer to the

76abda73-ff56-4a9d-b27f-e3e1b0ba7f2b-1
00:20:54.857 --> 00:21:00.435
patient and the radiation source,
in reality the nurses in every case,

76abda73-ff56-4a9d-b27f-e3e1b0ba7f2b-2
00:21:00.435 --> 00:21:04.600
we are only in certain cases during the
day or week.

ab2f16b0-b503-4a13-80da-8d2c1cd15661-0
00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:09.475
So that while per case the nurse dosing
may be lower,

ab2f16b0-b503-4a13-80da-8d2c1cd15661-1
00:21:09.475 --> 00:21:14.360
they get a they get a fairly voluminous
dosing perspective.

7dd8067e-b3d2-424a-8196-4ad48158d0a2-0
00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:20.317
So if we look now on the left hand side,
we see that and we just focus on the blue,

7dd8067e-b3d2-424a-8196-4ad48158d0a2-1
00:21:20.317 --> 00:21:24.147
blue bars here,
we can see that the average dose that

7dd8067e-b3d2-424a-8196-4ad48158d0a2-2
00:21:24.147 --> 00:21:28.829
folks in the various positions receive is
can be quite different,

7dd8067e-b3d2-424a-8196-4ad48158d0a2-3
00:21:28.829 --> 00:21:34.361
but striking and dramatically a lot,
especially for the people at the head of

7dd8067e-b3d2-424a-8196-4ad48158d0a2-4
00:21:34.361 --> 00:21:36.560
the table, even with shielding.

87571580-cea4-4ba6-b2ab-e4435a85cae9-0
00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:41.838
So the echo anesthesia and EP techs who
are at the head or side of the table

87571580-cea4-4ba6-b2ab-e4435a85cae9-1
00:21:41.838 --> 00:21:46.760
where there's no radiation shielding can
receive significant doses of radiation.

1e14ffd6-d8fe-48b9-85ea-1ad425606114-0
00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:52.000
The angiographer and radiology tech or a
fellow whoever standing next to that

1e14ffd6-d8fe-48b9-85ea-1ad425606114-1
00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.800
person receives somewhat less.

d0632a62-edb4-4e3f-80bd-f71561a83042-0
00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:57.955
And then the nurse,
the circulating nurse receives about the

d0632a62-edb4-4e3f-80bd-f71561a83042-1
00:21:57.955 --> 00:22:00.714
same as the assistant,
but remembering that she,

d0632a62-edb4-4e3f-80bd-f71561a83042-2
00:22:00.714 --> 00:22:03.080
she or he will get that all day every day.

d9eb72b8-96c4-433e-b811-2387933005a4-0
00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:08.393
Now,
if we look at what the average the

d9eb72b8-96c4-433e-b811-2387933005a4-1
00:22:08.393 --> 00:22:14.460
radiation exposure is for interventional
radiologists as an example of a cohort

d9eb72b8-96c4-433e-b811-2387933005a4-2
00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:18.783
who receives radiation in their work,
we see that again,

d9eb72b8-96c4-433e-b811-2387933005a4-3
00:22:18.783 --> 00:22:20.680
3 millisieverts per year.

c60c4678-9028-4400-aaf4-885b681c34d4-0
00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:23.567
And if we look at the average nuclear
power plant worker,

c60c4678-9028-4400-aaf4-885b681c34d4-1
00:22:23.567 --> 00:22:25.160
they receive about half of that.

8185d0c7-a8b9-4e58-ab7d-7c84af96ddb1-0
00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:28.805
So we're not talking about, you know,
inordinate, sorry,

8185d0c7-a8b9-4e58-ab7d-7c84af96ddb1-1
00:22:28.805 --> 00:22:33.298
inordinately small amounts of radiation,
but in fact fairly significant amounts of

8185d0c7-a8b9-4e58-ab7d-7c84af96ddb1-2
00:22:33.298 --> 00:22:33.840
radiation.

1e6d2436-3536-4561-9580-30143b541679-0
00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:35.680
And this has its effect.

73e30bb1-bd58-4fbc-9bb5-14098bda63fa-0
00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:41.735
There are now documented effects of
radiation related illnesses in doctors,

73e30bb1-bd58-4fbc-9bb5-14098bda63fa-1
00:22:41.735 --> 00:22:43.000
nurses and techs.

8b33b6fe-24fe-4906-82bc-0e6c2e3e95e2-0
00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:45.898
There's a three,
three fold risk of cancer,

8b33b6fe-24fe-4906-82bc-0e6c2e3e95e2-1
00:22:45.898 --> 00:22:49.040
specifically brain,
hematologic and skin carcinoma.

56b86535-3981-4246-aab8-25d4de86e3ca-0
00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:53.388
A6 fold risk of cataracts and
specifically posterior cataracts,

56b86535-3981-4246-aab8-25d4de86e3ca-1
00:22:53.388 --> 00:22:56.080
which are a signature of radiation
exposure.

cb8c07d3-19dc-4152-a4a4-647cbf2cece8-0
00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:58.360
And then there's cardiovascular disease
as well.

2cfd190d-c65c-4005-bd6a-5cad077ab8d1-0
00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:03.280
So that's on the oncologic side,
but what about on the orthopedic side?

d906ecbe-c810-461d-a432-1ebbd3ac4e44-0
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:09.187
Even though we are still exposed to a lot
of radiation and having the effects on

d906ecbe-c810-461d-a432-1ebbd3ac4e44-1
00:23:09.187 --> 00:23:12.709
the oncologic side,
we we are wearing what we think is

d906ecbe-c810-461d-a432-1ebbd3ac4e44-2
00:23:12.709 --> 00:23:17.320
adequate protection and it's heavy and we
wear it a lot during the day.

4144aa71-8a50-4c69-b8bb-c2ffdda7879e-0
00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:22.535
And if we look at physicians across the
spectrum of orthopedic injury,

4144aa71-8a50-4c69-b8bb-c2ffdda7879e-1
00:23:22.535 --> 00:23:26.840
we see that at least 1/3 of physicians
will have back problems,

4144aa71-8a50-4c69-b8bb-c2ffdda7879e-2
00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:31.952
Another 15% will have neck problems,
another 15 or so percent will have leg

4144aa71-8a50-4c69-b8bb-c2ffdda7879e-3
00:23:31.952 --> 00:23:37.467
problems and other issues largely related
to the basically occupational hazard of

4144aa71-8a50-4c69-b8bb-c2ffdda7879e-4
00:23:37.467 --> 00:23:38.880
wearing lead all day.

58eb1806-0390-4f00-baf1-f0b1c9ca9aad-0
00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:44.260
And it leads to not only these issues of
orthopedic injury,

58eb1806-0390-4f00-baf1-f0b1c9ca9aad-1
00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:50.132
but also frankly some disability in the
sense that patients retire or cut back

58eb1806-0390-4f00-baf1-f0b1c9ca9aad-2
00:23:50.132 --> 00:23:56.228
from work because of their their injuries
or pain related to the wearing of heavy

58eb1806-0390-4f00-baf1-f0b1c9ca9aad-3
00:23:56.228 --> 00:23:56.600
lead.

50f5f434-29cd-4823-9844-61f107e4c104-0
00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:01.829
So what then are the mandates for future
radiation protection systems given what

50f5f434-29cd-4823-9844-61f107e4c104-1
00:24:01.829 --> 00:24:02.760
we just talked about?

3c6dcf7f-72a6-4afb-9931-1fc947d1afa6-0
00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:06.332
Well,
we want to see less radiation across all

3c6dcf7f-72a6-4afb-9931-1fc947d1afa6-1
00:24:06.332 --> 00:24:10.520
roles in the lab and we'd like to see
dosimetry documentation of this.

ff3d3628-91a1-47d3-9f47-c73d33a83433-0
00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:14.480
We'd like to see lower weight personal
lead.

1da2a490-2f04-40bf-b86c-5616dd5ae4ef-0
00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:20.840
So there's a lot of kind of hype out
there about shedding the lead and so on.

639b5b84-03b6-4d2f-a8e7-c4a48108f224-0
00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:24.047
And while that's, you know,
ultimately a great idea,

639b5b84-03b6-4d2f-a8e7-c4a48108f224-1
00:24:24.047 --> 00:24:27.800
I think it's going to be difficult to
entirely shed the lead.

d447bdc6-6a19-4826-afd8-cf738825939e-0
00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:29.120
And I'll show you why here in a second.

15d69ce5-b12f-4d49-83ab-132aebf02204-0
00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:37.144
But lower weight lead is meaningful in
terms of its orthopedic impacts on how we

15d69ce5-b12f-4d49-83ab-132aebf02204-1
00:24:37.144 --> 00:24:38.760
do in the long term.

199f6f53-3d7e-4f42-9aa0-5f94bf42e8dd-0
00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:43.970
So as an example, I've,
I've worn the light lead just to try it

199f6f53-3d7e-4f42-9aa0-5f94bf42e8dd-1
00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:47.440
on and it's like a raincoat or or a
winter coat.

ee0373a7-1ddd-4ffb-97a1-8b5bfd240149-0
00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:50.273
It's very,
it's really very not very heavy and could

ee0373a7-1ddd-4ffb-97a1-8b5bfd240149-1
00:24:50.273 --> 00:24:52.840
be easily and comfortably worn most of
the day.

316b1a26-5b0a-4979-b243-7ab903c6fc02-0
00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:57.164
Any,
any scattered radiation protection system

316b1a26-5b0a-4979-b243-7ab903c6fc02-1
00:24:57.164 --> 00:25:01.102
should have the flexibility to
accommodate multiple various procedure

316b1a26-5b0a-4979-b243-7ab903c6fc02-2
00:25:01.102 --> 00:25:01.440
types.

8e815047-8837-4dfa-b7bb-ac2b1d64e435-0
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:07.477
So neuro intervention, cardiac,
structural, coronary, abdominal,

8e815047-8837-4dfa-b7bb-ac2b1d64e435-1
00:25:07.477 --> 00:25:14.471
lower extremity and so on that, you know,
the best system would accommodate all of

8e815047-8837-4dfa-b7bb-ac2b1d64e435-2
00:25:14.471 --> 00:25:17.000
these various procedure types.

4540b87b-0acf-4806-a91d-888847b1e21d-0
00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:22.000
There should be ease of access to the
patient in emergent and urgent situations.

50a636b3-cb9c-4bfa-bfdf-c344fbf5f6fc-0
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.775
I can,
I can easily build a cave the patient can

50a636b3-cb9c-4bfa-bfdf-c344fbf5f6fc-1
00:25:24.775 --> 00:25:27.721
sit in and I can't get radiation from
that patient,

50a636b3-cb9c-4bfa-bfdf-c344fbf5f6fc-2
00:25:27.721 --> 00:25:31.799
But that limits my access to the patient
in terms of urgent situations.

677903cf-5ca1-4ebd-8acc-7bab42ca831b-0
00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:36.556
It may make it difficult to communicate
with the patient because of actually

677903cf-5ca1-4ebd-8acc-7bab42ca831b-1
00:25:36.556 --> 00:25:40.153
hearing what's going on or,
or needing to administer medications,

677903cf-5ca1-4ebd-8acc-7bab42ca831b-2
00:25:40.153 --> 00:25:41.080
oxygen and so on.

aa40f4a9-b869-4dd8-8b08-4e5cf6faffcc-0
00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:44.283
And then lastly,
there should be limited workflow

aa40f4a9-b869-4dd8-8b08-4e5cf6faffcc-1
00:25:44.283 --> 00:25:44.880
disruptions.

7f27d5ab-3791-4c7c-b57c-0b9245e52ad3-0
00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:49.244
And I want to spend a minute talking
about this because pretty much any,

7f27d5ab-3791-4c7c-b57c-0b9245e52ad3-1
00:25:49.244 --> 00:25:52.711
any radiation protection system we can
imagine will will,

7f27d5ab-3791-4c7c-b57c-0b9245e52ad3-2
00:25:52.711 --> 00:25:55.880
will require some attention to radiation
protection.

e027995d-f22a-4291-b86f-0dff74fc3365-0
00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:59.560
It's not going to be just, you know,
set it and forget it.

fd57e128-c8ba-45f1-990a-e6f9d8a607d0-0
00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:02.960
We are going to have to pay more
attention to radiation protection.

97978deb-af6f-4064-a318-44b2ed22c933-0
00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:07.037
And there may be slight alterations in
how we do our work,

97978deb-af6f-4064-a318-44b2ed22c933-1
00:26:07.037 --> 00:26:10.680
but it shouldn't really make major
disruptions in our workflow.

8f1a609d-93d0-41cc-9069-c31fbd80e916-0
00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:15.624
And if I can pause here for a second and
say that, you know,

8f1a609d-93d0-41cc-9069-c31fbd80e916-1
00:26:15.624 --> 00:26:20.377
in my generation of people doing
interventional work, radiologists,

8f1a609d-93d0-41cc-9069-c31fbd80e916-2
00:26:20.377 --> 00:26:23.663
vascular surgeons,
cardiologists and so on it,

8f1a609d-93d0-41cc-9069-c31fbd80e916-3
00:26:23.663 --> 00:26:29.115
we have really for the last 50 years or
so been the first generation in human

8f1a609d-93d0-41cc-9069-c31fbd80e916-4
00:26:29.115 --> 00:26:33.240
history to stand in front of radiation
with heavy lead on.

d3f1db24-242e-43cb-bd78-cdca4d9cd117-0
00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:38.092
And now that we know what the effects of
those those activities are,

d3f1db24-242e-43cb-bd78-cdca4d9cd117-1
00:26:38.092 --> 00:26:43.190
it would it would make sense for us not
to expose our next generation to those

d3f1db24-242e-43cb-bd78-cdca4d9cd117-2
00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:45.320
same risks and orthopedic injury.

2fa933be-7a71-4f40-8f19-8752fa4f9b99-0
00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:49.664
All right,
so I'm going to go through several

2fa933be-7a71-4f40-8f19-8752fa4f9b99-1
00:26:49.664 --> 00:26:52.736
systems here and talk about how they're
set up,

2fa933be-7a71-4f40-8f19-8752fa4f9b99-2
00:26:52.736 --> 00:26:56.384
what their intentions are in terms of
slowing radiation,

2fa933be-7a71-4f40-8f19-8752fa4f9b99-3
00:26:56.384 --> 00:27:01.632
and also where there's a data or evidence,
I'm going to use that to highlight the

2fa933be-7a71-4f40-8f19-8752fa4f9b99-4
00:27:01.632 --> 00:27:02.080
system.

21bc966b-338b-40da-a93d-fd39d7086302-0
00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:04.240
So this is the Proteo modular system.

30e06e8a-701f-4f41-82bc-468b4b04fb8b-0
00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:12.171
You can see that it's it's a augmented
radiation protection shielding with a

30e06e8a-701f-4f41-82bc-468b4b04fb8b-1
00:27:12.171 --> 00:27:19.052
screen that goes over the patient's
abdomen or upper abdomen or lower chest

30e06e8a-701f-4f41-82bc-468b4b04fb8b-2
00:27:19.052 --> 00:27:26.567
mobile system which Shields at the at the
head and then all this draping and other

30e06e8a-701f-4f41-82bc-468b4b04fb8b-3
00:27:26.567 --> 00:27:32.000
shielding here that helps with scatter
radiation reduction.

a5bd0551-5b30-4759-bf10-4907be741a68-0
00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:36.880
This is what the system looks like on a
floor mounted device.

4df9dbdd-28ff-40fe-91e4-17d9321f7a49-0
00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:44.360
And here's the attachments to table and
or floor melted system.

b5825907-f2f3-48d0-b162-015e73354bc0-0
00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:50.684
And you can see what it looks like here
when it's assembled in this various

b5825907-f2f3-48d0-b162-015e73354bc0-1
00:27:50.684 --> 00:27:51.600
iterations.

5941051a-649f-417c-9c34-92c12bb7904c-0
00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:55.680
The Rampart system is the next system
we'll discuss.

b66c1f11-e576-41fd-a6d8-8ae12600d92c-0
00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:59.400
Here are the components of the Rampart
system.

28e2c15a-184c-4d6b-8e74-a78179f2ebd6-0
00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:03.080
They are again shielding.

c917c38b-6a22-4028-b13f-6fa7e7113131-0
00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:06.986
If I you can see my arrow here,
the shielding in the upper right hand

c917c38b-6a22-4028-b13f-6fa7e7113131-1
00:28:06.986 --> 00:28:09.497
here,
which goes over the patient's body and

c917c38b-6a22-4028-b13f-6fa7e7113131-2
00:28:09.497 --> 00:28:13.236
really protects from scatter radiation
emanating from the patient,

c917c38b-6a22-4028-b13f-6fa7e7113131-3
00:28:13.236 --> 00:28:17.533
which is the majority of scatter of
radiation that we get from the patient's

c917c38b-6a22-4028-b13f-6fa7e7113131-4
00:28:17.533 --> 00:28:19.040
torso or thorax or abdomen.

d0994762-2a14-4d76-97d0-7aaa88ac7abb-0
00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:22.520
There's liners underneath the patient.

3ca634a1-0eb2-452f-9814-4bb1baf24d4f-0
00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:26.200
There's support systems for hanging the
lead.

410ed3c6-b06f-4c01-a21c-44379a8ab0c9-0
00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:31.394
There's floor mounted systems which are
mobile and these are the curtains that

410ed3c6-b06f-4c01-a21c-44379a8ab0c9-1
00:28:31.394 --> 00:28:34.080
are aprons that go on the side of the
table.

b7eb58a3-0670-4ea0-8cd6-641d598d2381-0
00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:39.336
And again,
floor mounted radiation systems for for

b7eb58a3-0670-4ea0-8cd6-641d598d2381-1
00:28:39.336 --> 00:28:42.120
flexibility around the table.

23331f72-a5d0-4f03-84f9-2178783adda5-0
00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:51.246
So the Rampart has the ability to provide
radiation protection regardless of the

23331f72-a5d0-4f03-84f9-2178783adda5-1
00:28:51.246 --> 00:28:54.040
type of procedure that's being done.

0b7b29d8-327b-4166-b66a-0075b421f166-0
00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:57.418
So in this case,
you can see PCI structural EP in the

0b7b29d8-327b-4166-b66a-0075b421f166-1
00:28:57.418 --> 00:29:00.672
upper left,
aortic intervention on the upper right,

0b7b29d8-327b-4166-b66a-0075b421f166-2
00:29:00.672 --> 00:29:05.240
peripheral vascular the lower right and
neurovascular in the lower left.

ff827148-bcef-4d6d-8077-bf34200ef2c2-0
00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:10.560
And so there is some flexibility here
there.

1b5537ca-a2a1-4f79-89d8-9bc012449e90-0
00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:14.931
There may be difficulty sometimes in
getting to the patient same thing with

1b5537ca-a2a1-4f79-89d8-9bc012449e90-1
00:29:14.931 --> 00:29:18.320
the Proteigo because patients really
behind a wall of lead.

d55bec8c-40ed-496c-b5cd-95d9a076702b-0
00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:20.960
So that's an important consideration.

28e0d361-a64d-43a0-83c4-c02f5b814668-0
00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:22.680
But this is fairly flexible system.

c6efa687-030f-4db3-b81d-493d20422da3-0
00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:30.073
And again,
it can be floor mounted or fixed ceiling

c6efa687-030f-4db3-b81d-493d20422da3-1
00:29:30.073 --> 00:29:32.680
mount and and or fixed floor mount.

f8f1b38e-dd42-4f82-88af-41a5e8e49ef0-0
00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.300
So there's,
there's some flexibility in how the

f8f1b38e-dd42-4f82-88af-41a5e8e49ef0-1
00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:37.600
system is configured within any
individual lab.

d1614e77-b051-409b-9230-0702d188909c-0
00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:43.280
And again, we talked about the the,
the modular methods here.

97eebf9e-a945-4e51-a897-8e17f554b4d6-0
00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:47.948
One of the things you're going to see
common in these systems in most of them,

97eebf9e-a945-4e51-a897-8e17f554b4d6-1
00:29:47.948 --> 00:29:51.978
especially the augmented radiation
protection is that they'll have a little

97eebf9e-a945-4e51-a897-8e17f554b4d6-2
00:29:51.978 --> 00:29:52.879
enhanced rad pad.

e5c77ffe-30e4-4e7d-b13d-04a55816d7d6-0
00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:56.332
So today we use a rad pad,
which kind of addresses part of the

e5c77ffe-30e4-4e7d-b13d-04a55816d7d6-1
00:29:56.332 --> 00:29:58.360
radiation that comes off the patient.

d0373ab6-50cd-4a5c-bd58-c9bccda9ecaa-0
00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:03.414
But these rad pads are really blankets
that go over the patient and shield

d0373ab6-50cd-4a5c-bd58-c9bccda9ecaa-1
00:30:03.414 --> 00:30:06.920
scatter from coming from their patient
more completely.

c6e15341-d3e4-4a6e-b317-5a0b564e2eac-0
00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:12.185
So there are data using the the Rampart
system,

c6e15341-d3e4-4a6e-b317-5a0b564e2eac-1
00:30:12.185 --> 00:30:18.304
there are two randomized clinical trials
demonstrating nearly 99 plus percent of

c6e15341-d3e4-4a6e-b317-5a0b564e2eac-2
00:30:18.304 --> 00:30:23.969
radiation attenuation and 20% more 20,
sorry 20 times more protection than

c6e15341-d3e4-4a6e-b317-5a0b564e2eac-3
00:30:23.969 --> 00:30:28.200
traditional lead aprons and Shields,
which is terrific.

9e8b64cb-1273-4fe9-90c8-764aa87dc069-0
00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:35.266
They're independent published head to
head trials with which show that it has a

9e8b64cb-1273-4fe9-90c8-764aa87dc069-1
00:30:35.266 --> 00:30:40.986
significant and meaningful radiation
reduction over other radiation solutions

9e8b64cb-1273-4fe9-90c8-764aa87dc069-2
00:30:40.986 --> 00:30:47.000
and it's superiority over the standard
shielding is evident using phantom models.

d3f514db-3232-4ede-96b8-f6994e994329-0
00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:50.979
And there are I'm sure many more than
1700 real world cases,

d3f514db-3232-4ede-96b8-f6994e994329-1
00:30:50.979 --> 00:30:54.801
but at least published showing this
greater than 99% reduction until

d3f514db-3232-4ede-96b8-f6994e994329-2
00:30:54.801 --> 00:30:59.012
radiation dose across the variety of
interventional procedures we described

d3f514db-3232-4ede-96b8-f6994e994329-3
00:30:59.012 --> 00:30:59.399
before.

fe820b25-e1cb-4c93-9a95-e18e1dc9d372-0
00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:04.311
So pretty good data and a system which
appears to nicely shield scatter

fe820b25-e1cb-4c93-9a95-e18e1dc9d372-1
00:31:04.311 --> 00:31:06.080
protection scatter radiation.

78e8eafe-9656-4cbf-9c0d-91ee25efd14d-0
00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:09.000
The next system is the Egg Nest.

1b33eb36-bb17-4892-8f3e-7da3a2a210f5-0
00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:16.406
The agnest is similar in the sense that
it's an augmented lead shielding solution

1b33eb36-bb17-4892-8f3e-7da3a2a210f5-1
00:31:16.406 --> 00:31:21.160
reduces radiation at least 97% for all
the staff in the room.

2caba36f-677a-4a38-a0ec-bf4287531ecd-0
00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:27.769
There are some disposable shield
components which are available and as

2caba36f-677a-4a38-a0ec-bf4287531ecd-1
00:31:27.769 --> 00:31:30.360
part of this device or system.

5af5dfb2-03c6-454c-a61b-debe467aa5ec-0
00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:35.597
The there are ultra lead aprons both made
available and possible for everybody in

5af5dfb2-03c6-454c-a61b-debe467aa5ec-1
00:31:35.597 --> 00:31:36.120
the room.

24ac04b0-6120-4f86-9b46-0076b03e2a00-0
00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:40.000
There are different styles of Agnes.

10400606-2cdd-4f30-a7b5-a054990267de-0
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.120
This is the XR and the next one is the
protect.

98ffaf20-5273-4cb2-8529-8510590448ba-0
00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:48.209
It'll it allows more flexibility in what
you're able to do with the eye eye and as

98ffaf20-5273-4cb2-8529-8510590448ba-1
00:31:48.209 --> 00:31:51.160
I mentioned before,
has disposable components.

61dfc857-6e24-4f17-9d27-1e501e3205ca-0
00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:57.220
And this is the Agnes Complete,
which has the most radiation protection,

61dfc857-6e24-4f17-9d27-1e501e3205ca-1
00:31:57.220 --> 00:32:01.360
at least 99%,
allows ultralight aprons for everyone.

661a3450-54a3-41d8-8580-68b5e3febeb6-0
00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:05.320
It's ceiling mounted and again,
has an optional disposable shield

661a3450-54a3-41d8-8580-68b5e3febeb6-1
00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:05.920
component.

285a7149-7bd9-4d1b-9bbc-6e88c38c5354-0
00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:11.280
Here's what the system looks like
installed.

fedde5c1-f4c6-43e9-ab05-401acd5bf2c2-0
00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:16.866
There's some flip components that come
off that that that can be moved on or off

fedde5c1-f4c6-43e9-ab05-401acd5bf2c2-1
00:32:16.866 --> 00:32:18.480
the position from the table.

d8d53322-5875-4be4-a259-3381dfd1f920-0
00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:21.720
There's a skirt, there's a shield.

4d7da6f8-686d-4528-b210-3043fd852ece-0
00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:27.426
Actually part of the the pad is a is a
shield so that there's no scatter coming

4d7da6f8-686d-4528-b210-3043fd852ece-1
00:32:27.426 --> 00:32:28.840
off the table itself.

34896ec2-72cb-4e1b-9a23-5c84169ece93-0
00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:33.383
And it actually quite,
quite a flexible system and allows lots

34896ec2-72cb-4e1b-9a23-5c84169ece93-1
00:32:33.383 --> 00:32:35.240
of different types of procedures.

e18825e8-0311-4f1d-a15a-a801f1416c8a-0
00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:39.789
This is that drape I talked about before,
which is kind of the augmented rad pad

e18825e8-0311-4f1d-a15a-a801f1416c8a-1
00:32:39.789 --> 00:32:42.000
which many of the systems will
incorporate.

6803748a-c8e3-43d1-a746-68f258fc5c9f-0
00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:48.651
There had been good data developed
through Egg Nest and you can see here

6803748a-c8e3-43d1-a746-68f258fc5c9f-1
00:32:48.651 --> 00:32:53.285
that in the various positions that we
talked about before that just about

6803748a-c8e3-43d1-a746-68f258fc5c9f-2
00:32:53.285 --> 00:32:58.170
everybody in the room gets at least 95%
or more radiation protection with the

6803748a-c8e3-43d1-a746-68f258fc5c9f-3
00:32:58.170 --> 00:33:03.180
with the exception of the nurse and the
anesthesiologist which have just a tick

6803748a-c8e3-43d1-a746-68f258fc5c9f-4
00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:04.120
less than that.

589e24ae-76c9-4e57-88ea-d5ff5e4d0168-0
00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:10.960
So pretty good radiation protection and
allows for a reduction in late lead to

589e24ae-76c9-4e57-88ea-d5ff5e4d0168-1
00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:11.840
light lead.

eec722b0-e3ed-4111-a72f-2e4b3f0d34df-0
00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:18.886
This is what the the Eggnest data looks
like if you were to compare it to other

eec722b0-e3ed-4111-a72f-2e4b3f0d34df-1
00:33:18.886 --> 00:33:23.579
standard shielding and it has
significantly really orders of magnitude

eec722b0-e3ed-4111-a72f-2e4b3f0d34df-2
00:33:23.579 --> 00:33:27.280
less radiation dosing as compared to what
we use today.

745addfd-73d2-4594-a983-a097f40ebd5a-0
00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:32.760
And lastly,
the radioaction dynamic smart shield.

08d56c8a-48dd-44a1-ba39-fe4531e98d1d-0
00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:38.746
This is a a different type of system in
the sense that it doesn't really involve

08d56c8a-48dd-44a1-ba39-fe4531e98d1d-1
00:33:38.746 --> 00:33:44.068
enhanced lead shielding and radiation
that drapes around the table of the

08d56c8a-48dd-44a1-ba39-fe4531e98d1d-2
00:33:44.068 --> 00:33:48.599
patient, but actually attaches to the eye,
eye and the source.

f83632c7-cadf-4084-b1bd-73600e96a161-0
00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:54.224
And the shield actually has five
programmable tungsten segments which

f83632c7-cadf-4084-b1bd-73600e96a161-1
00:33:54.224 --> 00:33:55.720
envelope the patient.

04fa6154-95f0-4417-8e62-b7f350ae2755-0
00:33:55.720 --> 00:34:00.320
I'll show you a video in a moment and
allow a flexibility and workflow.

156aa543-4b5c-4e1d-b7ac-b27b8459ae15-0
00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:06.560
These systems are fully integrated into
the C arm at a bedside control.

428b783c-da20-4830-b3b4-94b1e6481642-0
00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:10.040
And as you move the eye eye,
the system will come up and down.

46e8faab-d241-4983-afa1-fd0bc557b74f-0
00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:11.080
I'll show you that in a moment.

a728059d-177c-468d-82cc-2950a9073a65-0
00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:15.650
And there's a hover mode which allows you
to move the table and the system just

a728059d-177c-468d-82cc-2950a9073a65-1
00:34:15.650 --> 00:34:18.471
comes up a little bit,
allows you to move the table while

a728059d-177c-468d-82cc-2950a9073a65-2
00:34:18.471 --> 00:34:20.320
maintaining some radiation protection.

510def80-3e84-4617-8199-797b8c437c32-0
00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:26.824
There are there are levels of safety,
including both proximity and contact

510def80-3e84-4617-8199-797b8c437c32-1
00:34:26.824 --> 00:34:29.520
sensors, which keep the patient safe.

bb13e6ef-2ec4-446d-a4f9-7c14de6578bd-0
00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:34.988
And this hover mode I described before
allows you to be protected while you're

bb13e6ef-2ec4-446d-a4f9-7c14de6578bd-1
00:34:34.988 --> 00:34:37.640
still panning X-ray for X-ray runs in
positioning.

af543e26-06b8-4b7c-9005-4f6df21717fd-0
00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:43.630
So let's take a look at this in video
format and I'll try to narrate this as we

af543e26-06b8-4b7c-9005-4f6df21717fd-1
00:34:43.630 --> 00:34:43.800
go.

d40ce2d2-a668-4d1d-ab01-36363b24e0b4-0
00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:47.920
So as as mentioned before,
it's attached to the eye.

e855608c-fdf9-4e83-a090-5f3be0fd634d-0
00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:48.600
Eye.

6823e7d0-9ed6-4f76-aa23-74565f80a37d-0
00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:54.371
These tungsten fingers come out and they
envelope the patient and then flaps come

6823e7d0-9ed6-4f76-aa23-74565f80a37d-1
00:34:54.371 --> 00:34:59.573
down and basically enclose the patient
and really grab the radiation where it's

6823e7d0-9ed6-4f76-aa23-74565f80a37d-2
00:34:59.573 --> 00:35:03.280
originating in terms of both the
generation and scatter.

9ef78f99-c74a-4699-9550-468d8e720500-0
00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:09.407
And you can see these are extreme angles
that are easily able to be accomplished

9ef78f99-c74a-4699-9550-468d8e720500-1
00:35:09.407 --> 00:35:11.760
and still provide radiation protection.

640e0745-6e27-4ea8-a611-8e27a3071135-0
00:35:20.170 --> 00:35:23.111
I've already spoken about the steep
angles here and you can see the various

640e0745-6e27-4ea8-a611-8e27a3071135-1
00:35:23.111 --> 00:35:23.770
examples of that.

5dddeb1e-b65b-44f8-bfd3-a5bad774a975-0
00:35:24.730 --> 00:35:29.658
And it is programmable in terms of how
you want individual tungsten pieces to

5dddeb1e-b65b-44f8-bfd3-a5bad774a975-1
00:35:29.658 --> 00:35:30.290
come down.

5c8f8ea4-0c4c-4ff0-af62-5db6dfb2fe51-0
00:35:31.410 --> 00:35:31.930
Excuse me.

be614ca8-8bef-4c73-861d-494e99a847f4-0
00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:37.525
So that for any given procedure,
like an EP procedure or something like

be614ca8-8bef-4c73-861d-494e99a847f4-1
00:35:37.525 --> 00:35:40.596
that,
you could have different configurations

be614ca8-8bef-4c73-861d-494e99a847f4-2
00:35:40.596 --> 00:35:43.600
because it's attached to the imaging
system.

5475f071-0b88-4fc1-9f94-03aab42c8817-0
00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:45.520
It's an FDA Class 2 device.

f8de07d5-c284-45c6-93a0-2630f74f6d77-0
00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:50.503
The FDA has to clear its use and has,
and you can see in the bottom screen here

f8de07d5-c284-45c6-93a0-2630f74f6d77-1
00:35:50.503 --> 00:35:54.670
an installation at Saint Francis Hospital
and Richie Schlafmis lab,

f8de07d5-c284-45c6-93a0-2630f74f6d77-2
00:35:54.670 --> 00:35:57.000
and that's Evan Schlafmis next to him.

822dd34d-de8c-4b30-b67e-1ceebe171fcf-0
00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:00.120
And they've been Richie.

b7d24d09-6583-414e-9c11-5c1876d3a876-0
00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:03.840
If anybody knows Richie,
he does dozens of procedures a day,

b7d24d09-6583-414e-9c11-5c1876d3a876-1
00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:07.134
works very quickly,
and he's been very happy with the

b7d24d09-6583-414e-9c11-5c1876d3a876-2
00:36:07.134 --> 00:36:08.720
workflow with this system.

227245f5-672a-498e-8277-19bb40c4a64c-0
00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:13.788
It does block scatter radiation at the
source and provides at least 90%

227245f5-672a-498e-8277-19bb40c4a64c-1
00:36:13.788 --> 00:36:16.680
radiation protection to everybody in the
room.

2fbf6e75-c1a7-4daf-be68-10b7ffde146b-0
00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:20.680
And we can use light lead with this
system as well.

d43fd7d4-1eb4-4a11-9c32-3ae1db7e5ef3-0
00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:23.983
Didn't mention before,
but because the system really is attached

d43fd7d4-1eb4-4a11-9c32-3ae1db7e5ef3-1
00:36:23.983 --> 00:36:27.269
to the eye eye and lifts up quickly,
you can get immediate patient access just

d43fd7d4-1eb4-4a11-9c32-3ae1db7e5ef3-2
00:36:27.269 --> 00:36:28.600
like you would with any eye eye.

4f04ba56-1512-428d-aefa-7bfdb7105efb-0
00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:35.163
And we've talked about the steep
angulations and easy turnover related to

4f04ba56-1512-428d-aefa-7bfdb7105efb-1
00:36:35.163 --> 00:36:35.520
this.

4ef6121f-06f6-42b7-b2bb-62e57d17ff1c-0
00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:38.540
So in summary,
as we look across these systems,

4ef6121f-06f6-42b7-b2bb-62e57d17ff1c-1
00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:41.589
there are multiple protection systems
that are currently or soon to be

4ef6121f-06f6-42b7-b2bb-62e57d17ff1c-2
00:36:41.589 --> 00:36:42.920
available in the United States.

b15d6fe0-d7c3-4ca5-8177-41362a25b31e-0
00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:46.240
That's great for us and for the next
generation of interventionists.

608b986c-ff1a-46de-a7b1-0dd96e6438c5-0
00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:51.267
The Shed the lead moniker is really
aspirational and may require state

608b986c-ff1a-46de-a7b1-0dd96e6438c5-1
00:36:51.267 --> 00:36:55.654
regulation changes or exceptions,
but the light LED is a very likely and

608b986c-ff1a-46de-a7b1-0dd96e6438c5-2
00:36:55.654 --> 00:36:59.080
acceptable endpoint and to me that makes
the most sense.

6e2ef430-cc72-470c-9f40-032bb3b197ce-0
00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:04.097
There may be times when radiation
protection may not be available to you

6e2ef430-cc72-470c-9f40-032bb3b197ce-1
00:37:04.097 --> 00:37:06.528
because of various things going on in the
room,

6e2ef430-cc72-470c-9f40-032bb3b197ce-2
00:37:06.528 --> 00:37:08.960
and you'd be good to have LED on at that
point.

89bb2646-1923-4d52-8d8c-fc13423c2a53-0
00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:14.043
System acceptance I think will hinge
largely on the ease of use,

89bb2646-1923-4d52-8d8c-fc13423c2a53-1
00:37:14.043 --> 00:37:18.560
the flexibilities for various procedures,
and the set up times and disposals.

817d3230-3aee-47c8-a214-0332b5a42c52-0
00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:23.819
And I think the days of ignoring sadder
radiation are hopefully coming to a close

817d3230-3aee-47c8-a214-0332b5a42c52-1
00:37:23.819 --> 00:37:26.495
and we have to give a little more time
and thought,

817d3230-3aee-47c8-a214-0332b5a42c52-2
00:37:26.495 --> 00:37:30.200
possibly some of the ease of navigation
to achieve superior protection.

0e9f1ae1-df81-4af7-bb24-5685dbaa6566-0
00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:34.516
But it's worth it, excuse me,
to both reduce radiation protection and

0e9f1ae1-df81-4af7-bb24-5685dbaa6566-1
00:37:34.516 --> 00:37:36.120
get out of our heavy lead.

50bb8fda-412f-4dd9-a76d-d9ef4451a1e2-0
00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:37.880
Thank you very much.

9df54288-fc50-49c4-beae-2d2f362200e6-0
00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:43.603
I hope this has been informative and I
look forward to our next generation of

9df54288-fc50-49c4-beae-2d2f362200e6-1
00:37:43.603 --> 00:37:48.960
interventionists having less of a load
than we did in the last 40 years.

10baaabb-f204-4b37-ad67-a50af8e702fd-0
00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:49.680
Thank you.

28a373ee-c544-4d71-8870-d28b089f9c87-0
00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:51.800
Hello everyone.

7a34999b-af2a-499a-a543-b13193fde7b5-0
00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:57.440
My name's Lancer Smith and I am a health
physicist at Heartland Physics.

b030aad5-f21c-4bc6-9cad-1c9d48e42ad9-0
00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:03.133
Today I'm going to be talking to you
about understanding real time dosimetry,

b030aad5-f21c-4bc6-9cad-1c9d48e42ad9-1
00:38:03.133 --> 00:38:08.297
really kind of how to monitor and protect
yourself using dosimetry and some of the

b030aad5-f21c-4bc6-9cad-1c9d48e42ad9-2
00:38:08.297 --> 00:38:12.839
pitfalls of modern day dosimetry in your
typical dosimetry that you use.

aa77754d-42b7-487c-b33a-a9d3fdda3d8f-0
00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:15.320
Yeah.

bfbbe0ee-a777-4d5b-854b-09d041084c58-0
00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:19.600
So there are no disclosures that I have
to present to you for this presentation.

bb0e9753-514d-47ca-a067-eed65e8d2734-0
00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:26.177
So anyone who's working with in
fluoroscopy or in a Cath lab or anything

bb0e9753-514d-47ca-a067-eed65e8d2734-1
00:38:26.177 --> 00:38:28.658
like that,
you have a unique risk that you're

bb0e9753-514d-47ca-a067-eed65e8d2734-2
00:38:28.658 --> 00:38:29.360
dealing with.

61b6030f-f328-484c-ae11-784a029021ba-0
00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:34.365
And that's the fact that you're among the
highest exposed radiation workers in the

61b6030f-f328-484c-ae11-784a029021ba-1
00:38:34.365 --> 00:38:37.720
world and that includes nuclear power
plants and everything.

8804a0ec-c581-46f6-aa93-0c397b74f8d3-0
00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:41.707
So if you're working in a Cath lab,
you usually have some of the highest

8804a0ec-c581-46f6-aa93-0c397b74f8d3-1
00:38:41.707 --> 00:38:42.800
exposures of anyone.

bccf4174-e2a7-41f1-809f-04a1c2695e52-0
00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:47.951
And the reason why you're getting so much
exposure is because you're getting

bccf4174-e2a7-41f1-809f-04a1c2695e52-1
00:38:47.951 --> 00:38:52.665
scatter coming off the patient and you're,
what's happening is the fluoro is hitting

bccf4174-e2a7-41f1-809f-04a1c2695e52-2
00:38:52.665 --> 00:38:55.106
the patient,
it's bouncing off the patient,

bccf4174-e2a7-41f1-809f-04a1c2695e52-3
00:38:55.106 --> 00:38:57.880
and then you're getting that scatter off
of them.

7c04b5e9-95f7-4bc6-984a-5ec0e6885644-0
00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:01.960
So you're getting that constantly every
day, every case that you're dealing with.

26e8ee5a-3b03-4836-9407-aeea13707acc-0
00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:07.857
And some of the potential risks that you
might have down the line from a long

26e8ee5a-3b03-4836-9407-aeea13707acc-1
00:39:07.857 --> 00:39:10.983
career in the Cath lab,
you might get cataracts,

26e8ee5a-3b03-4836-9407-aeea13707acc-2
00:39:10.983 --> 00:39:13.600
you might start to have some skin damage.

e6daaad4-7ef6-469e-a28f-b713377eb040-0
00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:18.200
I know some people have talked about like
losing hair on their legs or arms.

d5f42003-f7f9-40ec-b494-69204467785d-0
00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:23.029
That's from radiation exposure typically,
and there's even a potential risk of

d5f42003-f7f9-40ec-b494-69204467785d-1
00:39:23.029 --> 00:39:27.654
cancer down the line if you're exposed to
too much radiation chronically for a long

d5f42003-f7f9-40ec-b494-69204467785d-2
00:39:27.654 --> 00:39:28.480
period of time.

96cd09a5-9eae-47b8-91d0-8d16ca19f082-0
00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:33.560
So you kind of have some unique risk
working in fluoroscopy.

8b068de5-cac9-4379-b235-051fc0efca2f-0
00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:38.445
And I'm not saying that you will receive
those risks or you'll have those outcomes,

8b068de5-cac9-4379-b235-051fc0efca2f-1
00:39:38.445 --> 00:39:42.400
but you kind of have a higher likelihood
of getting those outcomes.

3fb83ad7-1a68-4192-8098-185b6431f0c0-0
00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:45.932
Now,
we're all familiar with our dissimeters

3fb83ad7-1a68-4192-8098-185b6431f0c0-1
00:39:45.932 --> 00:39:46.560
that we wear.

d170a09a-d403-49bb-9563-b291d75e05d1-0
00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:49.964
You know,
they're kind of just a badge that we put

d170a09a-d403-49bb-9563-b291d75e05d1-1
00:39:49.964 --> 00:39:53.520
on our chest on the outside of our lead
apron or kind of at our collar level.

4c405b06-0ebc-454a-9e5e-08709c5d83da-0
00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:56.712
And you wear them for a month or maybe
1/4,

4c405b06-0ebc-454a-9e5e-08709c5d83da-1
00:39:56.712 --> 00:40:00.600
depending on the rules of your hospital
and where you're working.

c0808987-7426-470d-b41a-e0b73b825b90-0
00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:07.920
And you send those back to the provider
of those dosimeters.

98138f58-1b06-453e-b2f0-577438a7a7c7-0
00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:13.600
And you don't really get feedback for
about a month after that, so.

492e9e0c-4bc7-4939-b95b-0b82188a73f5-0
00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:18.431
Typical dosimetry,
you don't really know if you're being

492e9e0c-4bc7-4939-b95b-0b82188a73f5-1
00:40:18.431 --> 00:40:24.074
exposed to a lot of radiation or not
until months down the line in a lot of

492e9e0c-4bc7-4939-b95b-0b82188a73f5-2
00:40:24.074 --> 00:40:24.519
cases.

29abd512-045a-4539-8c75-de7aa82c1807-0
00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:30.937
So it's more of a reactive solution than
a preventative solution for our typical

29abd512-045a-4539-8c75-de7aa82c1807-1
00:40:30.937 --> 00:40:32.680
dosimeters that we use.

26ec8c88-cb9f-4a5a-a34c-c2250942202d-0
00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:37.769
So you got that delayed feedback and you
know you can't see radiation,

26ec8c88-cb9f-4a5a-a34c-c2250942202d-1
00:40:37.769 --> 00:40:40.280
you can't feel it, you can't taste it.

2f93e85a-a5a2-4ef8-9b26-a56d942eb18a-0
00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:42.960
So you really don't know what you're
being exposed to a lot.

ed2d6f70-3e8d-4552-aa80-ed122e4505f9-0
00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:48.807
And so you're not getting any of that
immediate feedback or alerting saying,

ed2d6f70-3e8d-4552-aa80-ed122e4505f9-1
00:40:48.807 --> 00:40:51.242
hey,
you're in a high radiation area at this

ed2d6f70-3e8d-4552-aa80-ed122e4505f9-2
00:40:51.242 --> 00:40:54.435
moment, you know,
standing in a particular spot around the

ed2d6f70-3e8d-4552-aa80-ed122e4505f9-3
00:40:54.435 --> 00:40:54.760
table.

07fe9783-4e6b-4427-ad0a-b9b4550a8a9c-0
00:40:56.360 --> 00:41:00.920
So you're not getting that feedback in
real time with your typical dosimeters.

4e09973f-d1cc-4600-adbd-3dc9a95f029d-0
00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:06.306
And if you have some sort of, you know,
accidental habit that is unsafe and you

4e09973f-d1cc-4600-adbd-3dc9a95f029d-1
00:41:06.306 --> 00:41:10.285
don't really notice it, there's,
there's really no way to go back and

4e09973f-d1cc-4600-adbd-3dc9a95f029d-2
00:41:10.285 --> 00:41:14.320
track how did you get a really high
exposure during your work with the

4e09973f-d1cc-4600-adbd-3dc9a95f029d-3
00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:15.400
typical dissimeter.

48f65d6a-3411-476b-935d-5eed8fcf77d9-0
00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:17.440
So there's a lot of limitations with it.

abd0ffde-a2c9-4b08-9cca-9d30ea9bf962-0
00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:21.671
And dosimeters are good for you and you
should be wearing them,

abd0ffde-a2c9-4b08-9cca-9d30ea9bf962-1
00:41:21.671 --> 00:41:23.920
but there are some pitfalls to it.

a2771288-853f-415d-9530-7f25638911ed-0
00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:29.934
So real time dosimetry,
if you're not familiar with it,

a2771288-853f-415d-9530-7f25638911ed-1
00:41:29.934 --> 00:41:33.360
it's very similar to your dissimeter that
you wear right now.

0b7d4532-b148-4ca5-9092-82444282bf6d-0
00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:36.280
It's just a wear on flippable dissimeter.

5fa6fca2-ec6d-48ac-94c9-10a82784898d-0
00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:39.556
You know,
clip it on the outside of your lead apron

5fa6fca2-ec6d-48ac-94c9-10a82784898d-1
00:41:39.556 --> 00:41:43.160
and it'll usually display how much
radiation you're being exposed to.

f4fbbe3c-a9a9-46c9-b90c-ec68c624207d-0
00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:45.680
It might display it on the dosimeter
itself.

452884b1-3964-477b-af2b-7df0c4fcebaf-0
00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:50.025
But also they're typically, you know,
connected to some sort of network in the

452884b1-3964-477b-af2b-7df0c4fcebaf-1
00:41:50.025 --> 00:41:50.480
Cath lab.

b7ea3ae0-17ad-4820-a329-db5e1f08b472-0
00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:55.699
And there's usually a screen or some sort
of display hub in the area where it shows,

b7ea3ae0-17ad-4820-a329-db5e1f08b472-1
00:41:55.699 --> 00:41:58.120
you know, who's getting a lot of exposure.

bd1bd49d-a542-4f32-8448-c45be7ba29a0-0
00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:02.272
And they have some really nice graphics a
lot of times on those screens to show

bd1bd49d-a542-4f32-8448-c45be7ba29a0-1
00:42:02.272 --> 00:42:04.741
like, you know,
what's your dose rate and how much

bd1bd49d-a542-4f32-8448-c45be7ba29a0-2
00:42:04.741 --> 00:42:06.000
radiation are you getting?

d019bcc0-da46-4dab-8089-b2b9678a2a64-0
00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.360
And you're getting that in real time.

afb2bf5b-3852-43c6-b039-e93e23a663ef-0
00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:12.849
So you're,
you're seeing how much exposure you're

afb2bf5b-3852-43c6-b039-e93e23a663ef-1
00:42:12.849 --> 00:42:14.400
getting at that moment.

dc5988db-dbcc-4d88-a6fb-456d5ff0fd6b-0
00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:16.745
So you know,
at that moment if you're in a high

dc5988db-dbcc-4d88-a6fb-456d5ff0fd6b-1
00:42:16.745 --> 00:42:20.507
radiation area or if you need to step
back or if you know the shielding that

dc5988db-dbcc-4d88-a6fb-456d5ff0fd6b-2
00:42:20.507 --> 00:42:22.560
you're using, it is a place exactly right.

2c6eae44-a27d-404f-9dfb-876b47bd5b8d-0
00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:27.288
So real time dose symmetry gives you that
immediate feedback and let you correct

2c6eae44-a27d-404f-9dfb-876b47bd5b8d-1
00:42:27.288 --> 00:42:31.524
maybe any accidental unsafe habits that
you might have and let you correct that

2c6eae44-a27d-404f-9dfb-876b47bd5b8d-2
00:42:31.524 --> 00:42:32.160
immediately.

9b830578-ef3a-431e-b51e-cebad14b1666-0
00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:36.509
So some of those benefits that I talked
about,

9b830578-ef3a-431e-b51e-cebad14b1666-1
00:42:36.509 --> 00:42:38.800
it enables immediate behavior change.

7f53a9c8-bd9d-4931-91b2-48d7fe6b26e0-0
00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:41.798
You can see, you know,
the fact that there's a lot of exposure,

7f53a9c8-bd9d-4931-91b2-48d7fe6b26e0-1
00:42:41.798 --> 00:42:45.546
go ahead and make a change right there
immediately and you don't have to figure

7f53a9c8-bd9d-4931-91b2-48d7fe6b26e0-2
00:42:45.546 --> 00:42:47.280
out what it was months down the line.

da70563d-41ae-49fc-8cec-e7344d94989d-0
00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:51.240
It can reduce your dose drastically.

f3fd38a7-15fe-49a7-a29e-51a6a3b2da3f-0
00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:52.760
And this is very common.

07a7aeaf-a246-4ed6-82cb-ac337f350f7d-0
00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:55.994
There's a lot of studies out there that
talk about how real time,

07a7aeaf-a246-4ed6-82cb-ac337f350f7d-1
00:42:55.994 --> 00:42:59.669
just image or just symmetry gives you
that immediate feedback and you make

07a7aeaf-a246-4ed6-82cb-ac337f350f7d-2
00:42:59.669 --> 00:43:02.120
those immediate changes and it reduces
your dose.

a45d0456-30c4-47bd-8566-838486eee391-0
00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:07.051
It improves your awareness of how to use
your protective equipment,

a45d0456-30c4-47bd-8566-838486eee391-1
00:43:07.051 --> 00:43:10.160
such as your overhead shielding or
anything that you might have.

85551022-83cc-41a8-9f90-171f6d0b198b-0
00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:14.652
It lets you know that certain positions
are better than others around certain

85551022-83cc-41a8-9f90-171f6d0b198b-1
00:43:14.652 --> 00:43:15.120
patients.

9adb649e-416a-4869-947d-d6212712d621-0
00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:19.293
It also might remind you to put it on or
put the overhead shield down if you're

9adb649e-416a-4869-947d-d6212712d621-1
00:43:19.293 --> 00:43:19.920
not using it.

f618cf03-95fd-4ef6-badf-508137980afe-0
00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:25.818
And really,
it prevents that silent overexposure over

f618cf03-95fd-4ef6-badf-508137980afe-1
00:43:25.818 --> 00:43:26.640
your career.

684fd298-728c-4b46-bbd8-f14b59ca0a03-0
00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:30.924
And if you're able to prevent that,
then you're also able to prevent some of

684fd298-728c-4b46-bbd8-f14b59ca0a03-1
00:43:30.924 --> 00:43:34.032
those negative, you know,
outcomes that I mentioned earlier,

684fd298-728c-4b46-bbd8-f14b59ca0a03-2
00:43:34.032 --> 00:43:37.600
such as cataract, skin damage,
potential of cancer, things like that.

38add444-df0d-4ca6-b54e-2509cdb842dc-0
00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:41.861
So how does this work into the workflow
of, you know,

38add444-df0d-4ca6-b54e-2509cdb842dc-1
00:43:41.861 --> 00:43:43.840
working in the Cath lab every day?

38b66094-aaf8-4bcb-a39b-f06759591dee-0
00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:48.490
So just so you know,
your exposure limit for an entire year is

38b66094-aaf8-4bcb-a39b-f06759591dee-1
00:43:48.490 --> 00:43:49.560
5000 milligrams.

fcc4cec3-fbcd-4d05-95a0-694605a4ff99-0
00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:52.200
So we measure dose in in milligram.

d59de6cf-4e6e-467f-93d9-b06ce40c019a-0
00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:56.676
You're as a radiation worker,
you're allowed to get 5000 milligram in a

d59de6cf-4e6e-467f-93d9-b06ce40c019a-1
00:43:56.676 --> 00:43:56.960
year.

9a5c01bf-852d-4087-af6a-7f40c317c649-0
00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:02.218
So if you were to average that out over,
you know a year you're working,

9a5c01bf-852d-4087-af6a-7f40c317c649-1
00:44:02.218 --> 00:44:05.760
you really don't want to get over 2 1/2
Millerim an hour.

ff75005d-c4da-41c0-b4ba-f84d9c2a5223-0
00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:06.720
That's your dose rate.

99d0c35c-b71f-452f-b0ca-cbfdb8785f25-0
00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:08.400
How many Millerim do you want to get in
an hour?

0a029d06-1888-4303-a6e2-39048bbf494e-0
00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:09.480
2.5 Millerim.

f6f20169-74d7-407a-ae4f-9dd4e1813ca5-0
00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:14.466
So if you're looking at one of those
display hubs and you're using real time

f6f20169-74d7-407a-ae4f-9dd4e1813ca5-1
00:44:14.466 --> 00:44:17.570
dose symmetry,
anytime you see that your dose rate is

f6f20169-74d7-407a-ae4f-9dd4e1813ca5-2
00:44:17.570 --> 00:44:21.307
over 2.5 Millerim an hour,
you're probably getting too high of a

f6f20169-74d7-407a-ae4f-9dd4e1813ca5-3
00:44:21.307 --> 00:44:22.400
dose at that point.

5203241b-448c-4533-ac29-3deea44105f0-0
00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:25.118
Now,
that doesn't mean you can't go over 2.

5203241b-448c-4533-ac29-3deea44105f0-1
00:44:25.118 --> 00:44:29.352
5 milligram an hour in some situations,
you just don't want your average to be

5203241b-448c-4533-ac29-3deea44105f0-2
00:44:29.352 --> 00:44:30.800
over 2.5 milligram an hour.

906be1b9-c015-454b-955e-4314aa1dd1dc-0
00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:38.420
So also real time dose symmetry enables
workers to identify those high dose rate

906be1b9-c015-454b-955e-4314aa1dd1dc-1
00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:43.333
conditions during floral runs and it lets
you know, you know, hey,

906be1b9-c015-454b-955e-4314aa1dd1dc-2
00:44:43.333 --> 00:44:47.440
whenever I use Sinai,
I see my dose rate goes up a lot.

f454c38e-3aab-4735-a9f8-ff09e51f2c35-0
00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:51.000
So maybe I should step away if I'm using
Sinai or things like that.

27bccc14-c8c8-42c9-a984-b153e3e9bcf7-0
00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:54.509
But anyway,
it just allows you to get that

27bccc14-c8c8-42c9-a984-b153e3e9bcf7-1
00:44:54.509 --> 00:44:58.676
information that you need to reposition
yourself, reposition your Shields,

27bccc14-c8c8-42c9-a984-b153e3e9bcf7-2
00:44:58.676 --> 00:45:01.510
you know,
step away a little bit from the table if

27bccc14-c8c8-42c9-a984-b153e3e9bcf7-3
00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:04.400
you're using certain floral runs,
things like that.

f9904530-3a00-4d02-b7a7-fc91c200aeb0-0
00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:09.058
It just really helps you work and work
safer without really interrupting or

f9904530-3a00-4d02-b7a7-fc91c200aeb0-1
00:45:09.058 --> 00:45:12.000
being in the way of anything that you're
doing.

670404bd-688c-4d0e-a918-02a8c6935ee1-0
00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:15.180
So anyway,
some practical applications that you

670404bd-688c-4d0e-a918-02a8c6935ee1-1
00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:15.760
might notice.

4d09e721-a9a0-4658-8638-8809de9867c4-0
00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:19.958
If you're using real time dosimetry,
you'll notice that there are some high

4d09e721-a9a0-4658-8638-8809de9867c4-1
00:45:19.958 --> 00:45:22.720
dose rate moments like I mentioned
earlier, cine.

3c28a38f-518d-49bb-9985-131125ee230a-0
00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:25.654
And if you're doing a comb beam CT run,
you know,

3c28a38f-518d-49bb-9985-131125ee230a-1
00:45:25.654 --> 00:45:30.407
those are really high dose rate moments
and those are areas that you'll see your

3c28a38f-518d-49bb-9985-131125ee230a-2
00:45:30.407 --> 00:45:33.400
real time dosimeter probably start to go
up a lot.

fcae9636-5e1f-4e4f-85ff-00f67831f7e7-0
00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:36.395
I know a lot of times with comb beam CT
runs,

fcae9636-5e1f-4e4f-85ff-00f67831f7e7-1
00:45:36.395 --> 00:45:38.720
a lot of times you'll just want to step
out of the room.

f917502a-86a8-46f6-be7b-f8bdc5f3863d-0
00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:41.920
But with cine,
that may not always be possible.

9ce28a99-5af7-47b2-bf9d-d9688dbcc209-0
00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:46.824
So it kind of lets you know when you're
in those situations and also lets you

9ce28a99-5af7-47b2-bf9d-d9688dbcc209-1
00:45:46.824 --> 00:45:48.640
know maybe step behind a shield.

f7ac6b25-cb26-4abf-aa92-af8dd80d1026-0
00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:54.240
It also helps staff avoid staying too
close during those prolonged runs.

231e6c1b-ae1c-49f8-bf3b-19843de1a7da-0
00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:59.644
You can even use it,
It's great for training if you have new

231e6c1b-ae1c-49f8-bf3b-19843de1a7da-1
00:45:59.644 --> 00:46:04.319
workers in the Cath lab and they can put
those real time dosimeters on and then

231e6c1b-ae1c-49f8-bf3b-19843de1a7da-2
00:46:04.319 --> 00:46:08.760
they can just be alerted immediately that
they're in a high dose rate area.

283dccb9-4a75-41ea-a056-af1769ca7867-0
00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:12.407
And it's it's great feedback,
especially for people early in their

283dccb9-4a75-41ea-a056-af1769ca7867-1
00:46:12.407 --> 00:46:16.123
career, lets them know, hey,
if I stand behind the shield, you know,

283dccb9-4a75-41ea-a056-af1769ca7867-2
00:46:16.123 --> 00:46:20.000
you can really see how much your dose
rate drops in certain situations.

f98762aa-e6e6-4257-81ef-0f39ce9db7b5-0
00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:27.087
And also it provides the data to optimize
your workflow and helps you to reduce any

f98762aa-e6e6-4257-81ef-0f39ce9db7b5-1
00:46:27.087 --> 00:46:28.640
unnecessary exposures.

16a214bc-006d-43b2-91b8-900ea029e381-0
00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:31.622
So, you know,
one rule is you always want to be looking

16a214bc-006d-43b2-91b8-900ea029e381-1
00:46:31.622 --> 00:46:35.344
at the screen when you're on the floro
because if you're not looking at the

16a214bc-006d-43b2-91b8-900ea029e381-2
00:46:35.344 --> 00:46:38.919
screen, it's kind of wasting floro,
you're getting unnecessary exposure.

4fd0c9c7-543e-4790-9514-9e230630774d-0
00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:42.406
So you know,
it kind of just gives you all that

4fd0c9c7-543e-4790-9514-9e230630774d-1
00:46:42.406 --> 00:46:43.840
feedback all the time.

43335202-449f-484a-9b8a-22ccdbba41de-0
00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:50.521
And really all of those things that you
learn while using real time flora or real

43335202-449f-484a-9b8a-22ccdbba41de-1
00:46:50.521 --> 00:46:55.240
time DOS symmetry, it,
it starts to become second nature over

43335202-449f-484a-9b8a-22ccdbba41de-2
00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:58.513
time,
all those safe habits that you might

43335202-449f-484a-9b8a-22ccdbba41de-3
00:46:58.513 --> 00:47:03.840
develop and just the closing thoughts
kind of like a little overview,

43335202-449f-484a-9b8a-22ccdbba41de-4
00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:10.234
real time dosimetry and helps enhance the
radiation safety culture that display hub

43335202-449f-484a-9b8a-22ccdbba41de-5
00:47:10.234 --> 00:47:14.040
constantly showing dose rates up in the
Cath lab.

cebfda4c-b1ce-490a-9c08-ac792d2e20a0-0
00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:18.643
It's just a constant little reminder, hey,
you want to be safe with the radiation

cebfda4c-b1ce-490a-9c08-ac792d2e20a0-1
00:47:18.643 --> 00:47:20.920
that you're using,
that immediate feedback.

98be223a-e666-4499-bd7d-01559f70c543-0
00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:25.840
It's a very effective way to reduce
expiration dose to the workers.

4e19a475-d868-4db5-b0c5-2b1175f9afa9-0
00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:30.912
Probably one of the most effective ways
is just knowing that information and it

4e19a475-d868-4db5-b0c5-2b1175f9afa9-1
00:47:30.912 --> 00:47:34.938
gives people accountability because
everyone's dose is displayed on the

4e19a475-d868-4db5-b0c5-2b1175f9afa9-2
00:47:34.938 --> 00:47:36.280
screen at the same time.

9d0b7a03-5cd1-4c3b-b9f9-9f8f1f889e9a-0
00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:41.741
So you can really notice that person A is
in a high dose rate and person B might

9d0b7a03-5cd1-4c3b-b9f9-9f8f1f889e9a-1
00:47:41.741 --> 00:47:44.978
tell them to move or change positions if
possible,

9d0b7a03-5cd1-4c3b-b9f9-9f8f1f889e9a-2
00:47:44.978 --> 00:47:47.200
if that's possible during the case.

8c2e37de-cf42-4d20-801e-0394b765da75-0
00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:52.803
And in reality,
it probably should be the standard of

8c2e37de-cf42-4d20-801e-0394b765da75-1
00:47:52.803 --> 00:47:57.071
care in these Cath labs,
mainly because of, like I said,

8c2e37de-cf42-4d20-801e-0394b765da75-2
00:47:57.071 --> 00:48:01.040
Cath lab workers are so overly exposed
all the time.

78914e2e-5b1d-405c-afad-36688ab88937-0
00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:06.720
And this just just knowing this
information reduces your dose a lot.

9a7d50a2-6633-4870-9d46-9778f37c88b3-0
00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:11.870
And it really can reduce the likelihood
of those negative biological effects that

9a7d50a2-6633-4870-9d46-9778f37c88b3-1
00:48:11.870 --> 00:48:13.880
you get from radiation exposure.

5b91af34-0ce1-4db3-aca6-14674b51494f-0
00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:20.560
And with that said,
that's the presentation.

a47263d3-3cee-4057-881d-fc0e77b9e011-0
00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:21.440
Thanks for listening.

12d39c09-d267-4939-b170-77c29ef0419c-0
00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:24.280
I have my e-mail down below if you want
to reach out to me.

f9c50dde-c7d2-4720-92cf-22f9d1c45f90-0
00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:26.960
And thanks for being here.

24474ba8-7dfc-4734-a379-bae2d3ba8ea7-0
00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:30.320
Hi, everybody.

5ecb37ec-4a85-4092-bc4c-53dd755dc8fc-0
00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:33.200
My name is Ajay Kirthane from Columbia
University in New York.

2016d252-5549-4221-8a22-cae5976632fe-0
00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:36.627
And I'm going to talk to you about why I
think your health should really come

2016d252-5549-4221-8a22-cae5976632fe-1
00:48:36.627 --> 00:48:39.000
first and why so many of us kind of
ignore that fact.

cebd4858-f4a9-4752-a4d0-b72de6f1cb92-0
00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:43.070
And I'll give you a little bit of a
personal story to tell you how I came to

cebd4858-f4a9-4752-a4d0-b72de6f1cb92-1
00:48:43.070 --> 00:48:45.080
realize that these are my disclosures.

1bacbca4-fc4d-4ab2-bc14-71adef12b3e3-0
00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:49.120
They don't have anything do pertinent to
the the topic at hand.

efdd94e9-3e15-4d36-aa61-f250b70cdb57-0
00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:51.680
But I will say an important disclosure is
that I'm a physician,

efdd94e9-3e15-4d36-aa61-f250b70cdb57-1
00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:53.840
which means I definitively don't take
care of myself.

34320a66-edb6-4bfb-a8ea-85b7962c227e-0
00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:55.920
So that's the background for this talk.

aa253443-69ef-417e-921e-9846caa17c70-0
00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:59.687
One of the reasons that I don't think
many of us physicians take care of

aa253443-69ef-417e-921e-9846caa17c70-1
00:48:59.687 --> 00:49:01.928
ourselves is because our job is one of
the, I think,

aa253443-69ef-417e-921e-9846caa17c70-2
00:49:01.928 --> 00:49:03.240
the greatest jobs in the world.

ab8c3194-aa20-4d81-9c3e-36f1a7139d35-0
00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:04.160
We're proceduralists.

93e62e86-0564-4f80-aa9b-9d89584455ff-0
00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:05.200
We take care of patients.

927f220a-3cb0-49d7-82ee-ab61728211d7-0
00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:10.080
I'm an interventional cardiologist and I
like this picture or this analogy.

b6892b6d-38bc-4623-8e26-392b5a05f3f7-0
00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:14.626
This is Chris Hemsworth, Thor,
and he basically says, you know,

b6892b6d-38bc-4623-8e26-392b5a05f3f7-1
00:49:14.626 --> 00:49:15.800
this is what heroes do.

77a44b31-4549-4338-b38e-7dbb66543551-0
00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:16.960
He's looking debonair.

ce5b4d3c-35ca-4e7f-8cda-c2f594fb36fd-0
00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:18.040
He's looking great.

08f08c05-1c0a-4436-a9f3-236a70f4fa78-0
00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:22.542
Certainly we don't all look like Chris,
but certainly we feel great in the lab

08f08c05-1c0a-4436-a9f3-236a70f4fa78-1
00:49:22.542 --> 00:49:23.760
doing the things we do.

4ee50c61-14e9-404a-8a14-6f21d3ccd6bf-0
00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:25.000
And this is just an example of that.

d8d38a6d-9c45-4b27-bec2-b61c671610eb-0
00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.662
This is a case,
an angiogram of severe coronary or

d8d38a6d-9c45-4b27-bec2-b61c671610eb-1
00:49:27.662 --> 00:49:28.080
disease.

ce03e089-b25b-475d-84a8-029dcf6b896f-0
00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:31.982
Patient didn't want to have bypass
surgery and I was able to treat this

ce03e089-b25b-475d-84a8-029dcf6b896f-1
00:49:31.982 --> 00:49:33.000
patient effectively.

76946c57-cf33-4223-91fd-ab06a6f36b77-0
00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:36.204
Immediately after the procedure,
the patient actually told me that they

76946c57-cf33-4223-91fd-ab06a6f36b77-1
00:49:36.204 --> 00:49:38.919
noticed they could breathe better,
they were feeling better,

76946c57-cf33-4223-91fd-ab06a6f36b77-2
00:49:38.919 --> 00:49:42.080
and I left this feeling really,
really good about but what I could do.

4d2de59f-d369-4ae1-a369-a3be3504705e-0
00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:44.968
And that's one of the reasons why I think
as clinicians,

4d2de59f-d369-4ae1-a369-a3be3504705e-1
00:49:44.968 --> 00:49:49.122
we expose ourselves to radiation and the
orthopedic injuries and things like that

4d2de59f-d369-4ae1-a369-a3be3504705e-2
00:49:49.122 --> 00:49:51.960
that come along because what we do is
truly remarkable.

db73b2db-ec6f-4010-9a33-9ad8e0dfd14b-0
00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:56.378
The purpose of this talk is to talk a
little bit about how we can be a little

db73b2db-ec6f-4010-9a33-9ad8e0dfd14b-1
00:49:56.378 --> 00:50:00.869
bit more thoughtful about how we address
those issues and at the same time take

db73b2db-ec6f-4010-9a33-9ad8e0dfd14b-2
00:50:00.869 --> 00:50:04.967
care of ourself so that we can
essentially continue to do what we do for

db73b2db-ec6f-4010-9a33-9ad8e0dfd14b-3
00:50:04.967 --> 00:50:05.360
longer.

6475f173-a55a-4d12-bbae-a69d0b044d27-0
00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:09.817
There's a survey in 2023,
the Interventional Society for Cardiology

6475f173-a55a-4d12-bbae-a69d0b044d27-1
00:50:09.817 --> 00:50:13.951
and Interventional Cardiology basically
did a survey on occupational health

6475f173-a55a-4d12-bbae-a69d0b044d27-2
00:50:13.951 --> 00:50:15.800
hazards of working in the CAP lab.

87bced9b-40e7-4d51-818d-22527bb46cb0-0
00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:19.421
Because we're exposed to radiation all
the time, we have to wear lead, etcetera,

87bced9b-40e7-4d51-818d-22527bb46cb0-1
00:50:19.421 --> 00:50:20.360
and it's quite sober.

0b3ed211-7427-4687-a143-028c7c026bd0-0
00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:24.033
There's about 2/3 of us who,
because we're wearing lead,

0b3ed211-7427-4687-a143-028c7c026bd0-1
00:50:24.033 --> 00:50:26.240
probably have musculoskeletal pain.

60b54612-8ca4-42eb-a3e0-c78e2e9e3394-0
00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:29.165
Obviously as you get older you have
musculoskeletal pain,

60b54612-8ca4-42eb-a3e0-c78e2e9e3394-1
00:50:29.165 --> 00:50:32.880
but it's certainly exacerbated by bearing,
wearing the lead that we wear every day.

2f8f5864-4620-41b7-9623-6e1f6b000d89-0
00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:37.717
60% or greater had greater than one
orthopedic injury,

2f8f5864-4620-41b7-9623-6e1f6b000d89-1
00:50:37.717 --> 00:50:42.818
with 34% of third patients experiencing
1/3 of physicians experiencing lumbar

2f8f5864-4620-41b7-9623-6e1f6b000d89-2
00:50:42.818 --> 00:50:43.800
spine injuries.

f283daee-c9c5-40ce-99ad-a5101595815e-0
00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:47.546
And one in five people actually had to
limit the amount of time they spent in

f283daee-c9c5-40ce-99ad-a5101595815e-1
00:50:47.546 --> 00:50:49.280
the cardiac catheterization laboratory.

e30169e4-d213-479f-bd05-edc204283e1a-0
00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:52.880
And this is not just for the clinicians
and the physicians that are working.

5d93c24b-30b7-44a8-8db0-d2a82a7da01b-0
00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:57.410
It's also the techs who work alongside us,
the nurses who also have to wear lead as

5d93c24b-30b7-44a8-8db0-d2a82a7da01b-1
00:50:57.410 --> 00:50:57.680
well.

ffaed169-041c-47e4-b9e6-dede9fbc3d16-0
00:50:58.480 --> 00:51:00.913
In addition,
the reason that we are incurring these

ffaed169-041c-47e4-b9e6-dede9fbc3d16-1
00:51:00.913 --> 00:51:04.610
orthopedic risks from wearing lead is
because there's a three fold higher risk

ffaed169-041c-47e4-b9e6-dede9fbc3d16-2
00:51:04.610 --> 00:51:07.840
of cancer and radiation injury compared
with the general population.

d90ce751-ad88-42f1-abf8-3889bd8dfccb-0
00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:10.849
So this is something that's necessary in
a sense,

d90ce751-ad88-42f1-abf8-3889bd8dfccb-1
00:51:10.849 --> 00:51:12.840
because we need to protect ourselves.

7177f83d-b17b-4635-be50-6f95a3539c86-0
00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:15.459
The,
the protection that we have is not always

7177f83d-b17b-4635-be50-6f95a3539c86-1
00:51:15.459 --> 00:51:16.120
fully protected.

6e765f52-3590-4882-9073-a5f855a2c8ab-0
00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:17.800
It's only where we're wearing the lead.

83072cc5-7d9f-4dae-bcb0-0c266b85a305-0
00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:21.960
But then that engenders another set of
injuries such as orthopedic injuries.

6aa3caeb-0bdd-47ef-8ba3-980738296024-0
00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:23.080
And this is the real deal.

66a29d3d-e361-4f20-88b1-97d9a02cf0b9-0
00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:25.280
I think we know about this.

a5680e28-5882-4443-b475-49b0199f09f1-0
00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:27.000
We don't really talk about it a time.

f016602c-0da0-423c-9e39-fede9bc0e027-0
00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.840
It's kind of just like part of the
business of going to do what we do.

59432872-2b3e-4d80-9456-5f5e21b05f92-0
00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:31.910
It's,
it's just the price we pay to take care

59432872-2b3e-4d80-9456-5f5e21b05f92-1
00:51:31.910 --> 00:51:32.720
of these patients.

f5f5dc36-95a1-48f3-8de5-d3396ba7935c-0
00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:36.560
But it's important to understand this is
happening to real people around us.

00d9132c-9457-4fae-9644-adaddd1afac7-0
00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:40.960
And so anecdote #1 Dean Cariakis is a
very, very well known cardiologist.

e9d4f1f1-3474-4d41-ba38-1c5ae9bdfaf8-0
00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:46.685
He's been a pioneer in our field and he
had had for many years, multiple issues,

e9d4f1f1-3474-4d41-ba38-1c5ae9bdfaf8-1
00:51:46.685 --> 00:51:51.691
but it really came to a head in 2024 when
he basically couldn't stand or use his

e9d4f1f1-3474-4d41-ba38-1c5ae9bdfaf8-2
00:51:51.691 --> 00:51:52.000
arms.

421d6695-8fd8-4033-a63f-d7cde5f54116-0
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:57.400
He had complete cord compression with
like, you know, basically paraplegia.

748f4329-3ee7-4cbe-a213-34be7aa413c5-0
00:51:57.720 --> 00:52:00.560
He underwent urgent decompression of the
cervical spine.

26535bd3-84e8-451c-9192-5d2e742768e2-0
00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:02.680
He actually had to be in the hospital bed.

27164cc6-3577-43fc-8261-54cbed34853c-0
00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:05.160
He had to straight calf himself and walk
with a Walker.

246cfe1d-fdbc-47a8-99f6-5783f0ff44d1-0
00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:06.960
And he's back working now.

b4a18521-6506-42d2-89bc-5cf9b76d6eeb-0
00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:10.943
But this was a horrible thing that
happened to him and he had had signs

b4a18521-6506-42d2-89bc-5cf9b76d6eeb-1
00:52:10.943 --> 00:52:13.875
prior to this work,
he was having neurologic issues,

b4a18521-6506-42d2-89bc-5cf9b76d6eeb-2
00:52:13.875 --> 00:52:17.582
would take some steroids,
it would go away, it would happen again,

b4a18521-6506-42d2-89bc-5cf9b76d6eeb-3
00:52:17.582 --> 00:52:18.080
etcetera.

1529756b-25ae-4199-9c31-1bc9fbc63e0c-0
00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:22.676
Their reason this happens is because we
in the Cath lab are exposed to

1529756b-25ae-4199-9c31-1bc9fbc63e0c-1
00:52:22.676 --> 00:52:26.400
extraordinary stresses on our body,
their spine in particular.

2a7cae9f-a5ba-455f-af13-e75bb6d2ca9b-0
00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:29.660
And this is just an example,
these folks have specific radiation

2a7cae9f-a5ba-455f-af13-e75bb6d2ca9b-1
00:52:29.660 --> 00:52:33.423
protection that's meant to improve
radiation shielding and certainly does,

2a7cae9f-a5ba-455f-af13-e75bb6d2ca9b-2
00:52:33.423 --> 00:52:35.480
but they're still leaning over like this.

632b2418-733e-46e1-9205-61434fdb9185-0
00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:38.995
And when you lean over like this,
you put a lot of flexion on the spine up

632b2418-733e-46e1-9205-61434fdb9185-1
00:52:38.995 --> 00:52:42.885
here and you're wearing lead in addition
and standing there for a longer period of

632b2418-733e-46e1-9205-61434fdb9185-2
00:52:42.885 --> 00:52:43.119
time.

46eaa940-683f-414d-b991-7a594f7a62f0-0
00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:44.560
And so this, this can be a real challenge.

183fc95c-24e7-49ae-bd88-2a119f7d7a2d-0
00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:48.488
And I credit Ajar Kochar,
who's done a lot of work in this area to

183fc95c-24e7-49ae-bd88-2a119f7d7a2d-1
00:52:48.488 --> 00:52:50.600
start bringing these things forward.

f0990891-a6f4-4178-a93d-c926e0a22169-0
00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:52.880
He's a younger guy who's starting to
bring these things forward.

92d4fc08-4591-4d12-bf37-8abdc4e78bf8-0
00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:56.582
Here's anecdote #2 Kenny Rosenfeld,
another interventional cardiologist,

92d4fc08-4591-4d12-bf37-8abdc4e78bf8-1
00:52:56.582 --> 00:52:59.840
is actually going to win the TCT Master
Operator Award later this year.

3eb9884c-d1d4-4d3a-be80-e6d03635f651-0
00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:01.680
This is his MRI.

0748a50e-05d4-4a01-9c19-5b6378e57aed-0
00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:03.440
And he shows this, this slide.

cae9d522-b18b-47d1-a242-9ba33ad7d442-0
00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:05.640
There's basically no discs anywhere here.

bb8ccb16-2d89-49da-82ae-10f97624a433-0
00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:09.454
There's bulging disc up here compressing
the, the, the, the,

bb8ccb16-2d89-49da-82ae-10f97624a433-1
00:53:09.454 --> 00:53:10.920
the roots and everything.

abfbdb3b-42f1-4286-a4ea-2cefd7daf283-0
00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:14.381
And he's had multiple spine surgeries and
it's still limited in terms of doing what

abfbdb3b-42f1-4286-a4ea-2cefd7daf283-1
00:53:14.381 --> 00:53:15.000
he wants to do.

efb2bec5-5e29-49f3-8807-1d771a2aa1c6-0
00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:17.997
But I'll be confessed,
I'll confess to you that, you know,

efb2bec5-5e29-49f3-8807-1d771a2aa1c6-1
00:53:17.997 --> 00:53:21.431
when I see older physicians like this,
even though stooped around and walking

efb2bec5-5e29-49f3-8807-1d771a2aa1c6-2
00:53:21.431 --> 00:53:23.677
around you,
you never think that's going to be you

efb2bec5-5e29-49f3-8807-1d771a2aa1c6-3
00:53:23.677 --> 00:53:26.935
because you always kind of assume that
this is just, you know, I'm young,

efb2bec5-5e29-49f3-8807-1d771a2aa1c6-4
00:53:26.935 --> 00:53:28.080
I'm healthy, I feel great.

039dd800-04a6-47ee-9a92-41eba13215c8-0
00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:29.360
And that's kind of how I was.

2d358cd3-514a-4931-a4cb-20668e504117-0
00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:30.520
I basically would run.

a122e981-fa59-423a-9b45-fcfb50585c71-0
00:53:30.520 --> 00:53:31.880
This is me running a half marathon.

4382206a-1f32-4c4b-9382-167cf4d5e80d-0
00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:32.760
This is me skiing.

098d3c3c-838d-4b78-b485-11178b05afa1-0
00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:34.600
And I would have a good time with my
family.

8e6ccd9c-4452-4a11-92a1-2f6999d00cba-0
00:53:34.600 --> 00:53:38.029
This is my brother and me after we
finished the half marathon and,

8e6ccd9c-4452-4a11-92a1-2f6999d00cba-1
00:53:38.029 --> 00:53:40.640
and I just kind of never thought this
would occur.

cff6e494-10dc-463f-bdad-8510f1c4f007-0
00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:44.686
I almost liking it to when you go to the
park and you're not a dog person,

cff6e494-10dc-463f-bdad-8510f1c4f007-1
00:53:44.686 --> 00:53:48.234
you all of a sudden notice there are all
these dogs in the park after you get a

cff6e494-10dc-463f-bdad-8510f1c4f007-2
00:53:48.234 --> 00:53:50.008
dog,
it's just this thing that until it

cff6e494-10dc-463f-bdad-8510f1c4f007-3
00:53:50.008 --> 00:53:51.960
happens to you,
you don't necessarily know.

84fc7833-8263-44c2-8148-655ba9177fac-0
00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:55.223
And so for me,
I was doing great like this until all of

84fc7833-8263-44c2-8148-655ba9177fac-1
00:53:55.223 --> 00:53:56.680
a sudden this was my MRI.

9b21fa33-50a1-4fbe-9758-235f022962eb-0
00:53:56.960 --> 00:54:00.058
And when you look at this MRI basically
here, all the nerve roots,

9b21fa33-50a1-4fbe-9758-235f022962eb-1
00:54:00.058 --> 00:54:01.400
that's kind of a normal area.

32258eb1-7deb-4383-b71e-e537f67982ea-0
00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:05.045
And this is this black thing is my disc
that's basically taking up the space

32258eb1-7deb-4383-b71e-e537f67982ea-1
00:54:05.045 --> 00:54:06.560
where those new nerve roots are.

1197bc6d-6a42-4585-af3a-46b2d3722870-0
00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:10.428
And I had excruciating pain and I
ultimately had to have surgery and this

1197bc6d-6a42-4585-af3a-46b2d3722870-1
00:54:10.428 --> 00:54:11.160
was a problem.

5fb6ed2f-2cbf-419f-9b20-d985d812a3ae-0
00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:13.600
It basically, you know,
you're confronted with it.

73979c24-1a99-49e0-9ba1-a6804400125f-0
00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:16.040
You say, Oh my gosh,
I need to limit my exposure, etcetera.

04413c9a-ef59-4f03-8390-101f159fb7e3-0
00:54:16.360 --> 00:54:20.745
But it turns out I'm not alone when
looking at myself because if you look at

04413c9a-ef59-4f03-8390-101f159fb7e3-1
00:54:20.745 --> 00:54:24.960
these rates stratified by age,
as we get older, it goes up and up and up.

6b224c5c-b06b-4840-86e0-a3762891e021-0
00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:28.315
But even when we're younger,
there's a pretty significant risk of

6b224c5c-b06b-4840-86e0-a3762891e021-1
00:54:28.315 --> 00:54:30.958
orthopedic injury as a whole in people in
my field,

6b224c5c-b06b-4840-86e0-a3762891e021-2
00:54:30.958 --> 00:54:32.840
younger interventional cardiologists.

e421e2e0-3f5f-4661-9b22-6a7e35736cb9-0
00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:36.748
And I think I borrowed the slide from Bob
Foster, who's kind of dedicated his,

e421e2e0-3f5f-4661-9b22-6a7e35736cb9-1
00:54:36.748 --> 00:54:38.975
you know,
sort of next phase of the life to,

e421e2e0-3f5f-4661-9b22-6a7e35736cb9-2
00:54:38.975 --> 00:54:41.400
to trying to make radiation better for
patients.

cb2d4877-0737-4322-847c-6c478da2ac4d-0
00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:43.727
And there are other people out there for
physicians and others,

cb2d4877-0737-4322-847c-6c478da2ac4d-1
00:54:43.727 --> 00:54:45.800
and there's other people out there doing
the same thing.

b53e3831-729f-48fc-b253-e94b29937799-0
00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:48.231
Basically,
when you start talking about this,

b53e3831-729f-48fc-b253-e94b29937799-1
00:54:48.231 --> 00:54:51.834
you realize that people are having to cut
back on their time in the lab because

b53e3831-729f-48fc-b253-e94b29937799-2
00:54:51.834 --> 00:54:52.600
they're pregnant.

921ecfa8-4220-4be7-918c-95d1534d1661-0
00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:55.382
They're, you know,
there's a rate of background cancers that

921ecfa8-4220-4be7-918c-95d1534d1661-1
00:54:55.382 --> 00:54:57.480
are happening, orthopedic injuries,
etcetera.

8b491a94-15f7-41f1-b735-0c3d19e6e77d-0
00:54:57.680 --> 00:54:59.680
And this effects all members of the team.

08078403-5972-44ee-ad59-c4cdc350c97c-0
00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:03.675
And so we need better standards and
better safety precautions to be able to

08078403-5972-44ee-ad59-c4cdc350c97c-1
00:55:03.675 --> 00:55:04.800
take care of ourselves.

2538b18a-cfd7-44c2-81f7-06ac6e3eb991-0
00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:05.720
So how do we do this?

7cbeea55-d995-46f6-ba83-d532f4aea0e5-0
00:55:05.960 --> 00:55:09.120
Well, there are systems like this,
their systems and, you know,

7cbeea55-d995-46f6-ba83-d532f4aea0e5-1
00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:13.120
pause this for a second because that was
me dancing after I had my back surgery.

fdf424af-8dd7-43de-94af-d15cceeb40cd-0
00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:15.743
We also got in our lab these types of
systems,

fdf424af-8dd7-43de-94af-d15cceeb40cd-1
00:55:15.743 --> 00:55:18.160
they could protect me so I didn't have to
wear lead.

139537e2-eab5-44f6-9a76-5d15b98303d6-0
00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:21.558
And there are many systems out there that
are now designed to do this that are

139537e2-eab5-44f6-9a76-5d15b98303d6-1
00:55:21.558 --> 00:55:22.720
getting a lot of attention.

05f0fa53-b1df-4373-b1a9-52d531ad4230-0
00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:25.440
But the problem is,
is we just kind of celebrate like this.

30f8431f-2cbf-44ab-92ae-9843768281c3-0
00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:28.800
So I'm back working on Indian,
doing my dancing.

103ab68e-11f5-41fd-bdd8-622394a9dc14-0
00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:29.480
I feel great.

9a5165aa-3e45-4c22-8e2f-9b4c957e692b-0
00:55:29.560 --> 00:55:33.440
My spine's OK,
but you have to do more than that.

6e9d6692-135c-4d1b-99d5-41c2d158d395-0
00:55:33.440 --> 00:55:37.078
And so they're actually studies looking
at stretching things that we can do to

6e9d6692-135c-4d1b-99d5-41c2d158d395-1
00:55:37.078 --> 00:55:38.000
strengthen our core.

fd55b0b3-6cfd-402d-8b73-cb7be1636dba-0
00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:40.410
Obviously,
getting out of the lead is a really,

fd55b0b3-6cfd-402d-8b73-cb7be1636dba-1
00:55:40.410 --> 00:55:42.720
really important parameter and an
imperative.

cdf2eac1-e0e5-4b9a-b097-9b6f8a78d147-0
00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:47.388
But it's also important to continue to do
core stretches and the like so that you

cdf2eac1-e0e5-4b9a-b097-9b6f8a78d147-1
00:55:47.388 --> 00:55:51.493
can strengthen all those muscles and
everything that allows your back to be

cdf2eac1-e0e5-4b9a-b097-9b6f8a78d147-2
00:55:51.493 --> 00:55:55.867
essentially decompressed in the sense,
or at least to take up the strain so it's

cdf2eac1-e0e5-4b9a-b097-9b6f8a78d147-3
00:55:55.867 --> 00:55:56.840
not on your discs.

618d48a8-6be8-484f-827f-1dd210ec6250-0
00:55:56.840 --> 00:55:58.240
And that's really, really important.

5af93aa4-40a6-4e44-b6ce-977a53bd9de0-0
00:55:58.440 --> 00:56:01.000
This is a study that was done in the Mayo
Clinic Cath lab.

5465fc7a-a10b-401a-85cd-e1dc9a231ae9-0
00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:04.154
The problem problem is if you don't take
care of yourself,

5465fc7a-a10b-401a-85cd-e1dc9a231ae9-1
00:56:04.154 --> 00:56:07.280
then this kind of happens over life and
you get increasing weight over time.

28fb1ecf-32a8-42bd-9141-29c76fc15cbf-0
00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:08.840
And I'm not going to go through the whole
detail.

e0b3e960-b4ea-4320-954a-d553d149ab57-0
00:56:08.840 --> 00:56:12.604
I've told the story at other conferences,
but suffice it to say that it wasn't just

e0b3e960-b4ea-4320-954a-d553d149ab57-1
00:56:12.604 --> 00:56:14.934
the back surgery that allowed me to
exercise again,

e0b3e960-b4ea-4320-954a-d553d149ab57-2
00:56:14.934 --> 00:56:17.892
you have to be disciplined about it and
you lose your discipline,

e0b3e960-b4ea-4320-954a-d553d149ab57-3
00:56:17.892 --> 00:56:20.760
your weight goes up,
and then all kinds of other things happen.

d42178d1-8a64-410b-b23b-75338f045fe2-0
00:56:20.760 --> 00:56:22.360
Like for me, it was hypertension.

e889ca03-3ea0-4c8a-928b-2814c269e99c-0
00:56:22.600 --> 00:56:24.400
It was also elevated cholesterol.

39a251c8-8d52-4e3c-ac70-5341a6a6fb25-0
00:56:24.560 --> 00:56:27.407
And ultimately,
it actually became a diagnosis of

39a251c8-8d52-4e3c-ac70-5341a6a6fb25-1
00:56:27.407 --> 00:56:27.920
diabetes.

24b0e14a-ccd2-4c0e-beae-8a63fbad3069-0
00:56:28.440 --> 00:56:30.996
Unfortunately,
I actually injured my back a second time

24b0e14a-ccd2-4c0e-beae-8a63fbad3069-1
00:56:30.996 --> 00:56:33.280
and I had to unfortunately have a second
surgery.

81a18b64-cd61-4a51-9e91-de19566a2f14-0
00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:35.480
And many patients,
people injure their backs.

9bb7b46b-97f9-419b-9c7d-324c8a93038b-0
00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:36.560
They don't need to have surgery.

44dde33c-f492-4095-90fe-1312389f06bb-0
00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:39.008
In my case,
the pain was so severe and excruciating

44dde33c-f492-4095-90fe-1312389f06bb-1
00:56:39.008 --> 00:56:40.280
that I did need to have it.

feaf6a90-7900-4b98-a52f-42b3c905b1df-0
00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:43.949
And the reason also is beyond what we do
in the lab,

feaf6a90-7900-4b98-a52f-42b3c905b1df-1
00:56:43.949 --> 00:56:47.845
we also have this issue if we're on our
phones, if we're leaned over,

feaf6a90-7900-4b98-a52f-42b3c905b1df-2
00:56:47.845 --> 00:56:52.297
it's essentially like adding weight to
our cervical spine on the order of 40 to

feaf6a90-7900-4b98-a52f-42b3c905b1df-3
00:56:52.297 --> 00:56:55.970
60 lbs just by leaning over and being on
our phones all the time,

feaf6a90-7900-4b98-a52f-42b3c905b1df-4
00:56:55.970 --> 00:56:57.640
being on screens all the time.

611c9a92-5dfb-447d-ba85-71fee769a202-0
00:56:58.040 --> 00:57:02.062
And if we don't take care of ourselves,
we neglect the ways that we can avoid

611c9a92-5dfb-447d-ba85-71fee769a202-1
00:57:02.062 --> 00:57:02.320
this.

53359632-85e7-45fa-9e30-1c095e5970c1-0
00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:05.075
So now I change how I sit,
I've changed my chair,

53359632-85e7-45fa-9e30-1c095e5970c1-1
00:57:05.075 --> 00:57:07.280
I do all these core exercises, etcetera.

fd71194d-a0a0-4702-8711-2b176015db7b-0
00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:11.040
It turned out though,
before I do that now ignorance was bliss.

d87f4445-03b1-4b39-837d-67be395f9143-0
00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:13.381
So before my second or after my second
back surgery,

d87f4445-03b1-4b39-837d-67be395f9143-1
00:57:13.381 --> 00:57:14.840
I've been back back skiing again.

8910b24d-3fe0-4a8c-8d74-eef05380eab3-0
00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:18.696
I was playing the guitar with my posture
is terrible here I was eating,

8910b24d-3fe0-4a8c-8d74-eef05380eab3-1
00:57:18.696 --> 00:57:19.400
eating poorly.

8c4453a7-ff8b-4c01-8ab7-3e0884cd15cc-0
00:57:19.400 --> 00:57:21.888
And what ended up happening to me is with
all this,

8c4453a7-ff8b-4c01-8ab7-3e0884cd15cc-1
00:57:21.888 --> 00:57:24.520
my hemoglobin A1C went almost into the
diabetic range.

e9f9fe30-b4d7-4397-b278-0feb23f63e4c-0
00:57:24.840 --> 00:57:28.640
So what I've done since then is you need
something to action change.

250b3df8-2fc3-42d9-bf2e-143e3c19da69-0
00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:31.080
For me,
this was the big thing that drove change.

15491e67-e6d8-43bf-9133-52f0649980f0-0
00:57:31.240 --> 00:57:34.160
Once I saw this,
I dramatically changed my diet.

f14f2e78-74e9-47bf-8447-b5b59d2ea4c8-0
00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:36.040
I've been more assiduous about working
out.

546409de-d768-4806-b905-4bbcd16e65fe-0
00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:39.600
My back actually feels better than it's
ever felt even after the first surgery

546409de-d768-4806-b905-4bbcd16e65fe-1
00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:42.080
because I'm really,
really meticulous about what I do.

f31c75ec-ca76-4621-896b-4d6250ac669a-0
00:57:42.360 --> 00:57:45.770
And as a result,
I've been able to drop like 20 lbs or

f31c75ec-ca76-4621-896b-4d6250ac669a-1
00:57:45.770 --> 00:57:46.080
more.

3a4525ba-ef58-485c-9966-95322c9e53bc-0
00:57:46.080 --> 00:57:48.840
And in fact, my A1C is now normal.

48225b90-d548-4a9d-ad9f-a8b93b1c11b9-0
00:57:49.400 --> 00:57:51.280
But the biggest question is,
will this last?

11f27a69-6b4e-4fa3-95b0-b0cca2b20f45-0
00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:52.480
Am I going to take care of myself?

490f0ae6-0b94-435e-a858-95a1b1c64c77-0
00:57:52.520 --> 00:57:55.248
I think I am,
because I'm sufficiently motivated now

490f0ae6-0b94-435e-a858-95a1b1c64c77-1
00:57:55.248 --> 00:57:58.800
that I've had two surgeries,
now that my hemoglobin A1C is diabetic.

2fbd6479-0d59-4352-afd5-20a6462482c7-0
00:57:59.080 --> 00:58:01.834
But I think many people out there are not
sufficiently motivated,

2fbd6479-0d59-4352-afd5-20a6462482c7-1
00:58:01.834 --> 00:58:02.920
and they really should be.

57fee827-994d-4332-a06e-d49fb11421c3-0
00:58:02.920 --> 00:58:05.280
And maybe they hear this talk and they're
a little bit more motivated.

47f10469-6215-4fb8-a295-e1efea2c1f56-0
00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:08.397
So the moral of the story is I think we
have a great job,

47f10469-6215-4fb8-a295-e1efea2c1f56-1
00:58:08.397 --> 00:58:12.428
but we really need to take care of
ourselves so we can continue doing that

47f10469-6215-4fb8-a295-e1efea2c1f56-2
00:58:12.428 --> 00:58:14.740
job,
especially when the job is inherently

47f10469-6215-4fb8-a295-e1efea2c1f56-3
00:58:14.740 --> 00:58:15.600
dangerous to us.

98832ab9-8b81-4063-ba70-3ffc9031a651-0
00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:18.695
And I mean, all members of the team,
irrespective of where you stand in the

98832ab9-8b81-4063-ba70-3ffc9031a651-1
00:58:18.695 --> 00:58:20.040
room, you're going to be exposed.

345205f6-d12b-4e5f-9555-5073a217fccb-0
00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:23.280
And you have to wear lead if you don't
have one of these systems.

ee7b97ce-0c44-48a4-9b52-8fcc0b363cc8-0
00:58:23.280 --> 00:58:26.120
And so as a result,
you need to be fortified.

9e964830-65cd-409e-b66e-28ecc1b4c699-0
00:58:26.120 --> 00:58:30.815
And so that initial slide I showed with
Chris Hemsworth actually is a part of a

9e964830-65cd-409e-b66e-28ecc1b4c699-1
00:58:30.815 --> 00:58:31.520
longer clip.

42dd2e87-21ce-4285-9455-0c4461bba936-0
00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:35.800
I think the longer clip is probably more
apropos of how we really are heroes.

c945ac92-f1fd-4ed3-8f83-1d2cb8448f4f-0
00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:36.880
And this is the whole clip.

2e24d725-3386-442c-b820-4dbb0fc7cd00-0
00:58:38.080 --> 00:58:48.326
I choose to run toward my problems and
not away from them because that's what

2e24d725-3386-442c-b820-4dbb0fc7cd00-1
00:58:48.326 --> 00:58:49.640
heroes do.

62264460-6119-45e2-a23d-85811d912dda-0
00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:52.840
So you can see her face.

b801040e-05dd-4b39-ac1c-b7c943d59236-0
00:58:52.840 --> 00:58:55.590
She's clearly not impressed because
obviously, you know,

b801040e-05dd-4b39-ac1c-b7c943d59236-1
00:58:55.590 --> 00:58:57.280
we're our own worst enemy at times.

e76c855d-8865-482d-9b98-5bd7b2df0b7f-0
00:58:57.280 --> 00:58:59.983
So for me,
the final checklist that I'll leave you

e76c855d-8865-482d-9b98-5bd7b2df0b7f-1
00:58:59.983 --> 00:59:03.694
with is I do think that we need to,
irrespective of what we're doing,

e76c855d-8865-482d-9b98-5bd7b2df0b7f-2
00:59:03.694 --> 00:59:06.080
do core stretches,
exercises and stretching.

5c3fbabc-1a77-4bd6-b653-04be5c2047e9-0
00:59:06.080 --> 00:59:08.600
It's got to be a daily routine for us
here on out.

e8069fb2-f771-4adc-9138-96a4f25464b6-0
00:59:08.600 --> 00:59:11.640
Every member of our team,
we need to make MD appointments.

7be4cac5-02a1-4af2-9c35-5dae7f635513-0
00:59:11.640 --> 00:59:13.360
Don't just check your lipids at a
conference.

9a2a7f99-6845-47d1-ad1d-0c18c5fbc492-0
00:59:13.360 --> 00:59:16.934
Actually see a Doctor Who's going to take
care of you and to address the issues

9a2a7f99-6845-47d1-ad1d-0c18c5fbc492-1
00:59:16.934 --> 00:59:17.560
that you need.

c5d34fbc-6238-43aa-8ec9-ae0e65e5845d-0
00:59:17.560 --> 00:59:19.741
Because those things that I had,
for instance,

c5d34fbc-6238-43aa-8ec9-ae0e65e5845d-1
00:59:19.741 --> 00:59:22.295
the diabetes diagnosis and the
hypertension, etcetera,

c5d34fbc-6238-43aa-8ec9-ae0e65e5845d-2
00:59:22.295 --> 00:59:23.920
could be taken care of in that way.

848fe31a-14a1-46fd-a57e-17a78cab372f-0
00:59:24.280 --> 00:59:27.901
I think it's really important to address
and look for radiation protection in your

848fe31a-14a1-46fd-a57e-17a78cab372f-1
00:59:27.901 --> 00:59:28.600
program and job.

962b58ee-5239-4a13-bab9-310a76a14c82-0
00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:31.736
Understand how it works,
understand where you need to stand to

962b58ee-5239-4a13-bab9-310a76a14c82-1
00:59:31.736 --> 00:59:34.182
reduce your risk,
and understand what ways you can reduce

962b58ee-5239-4a13-bab9-310a76a14c82-2
00:59:34.182 --> 00:59:36.080
your risk by getting out of lead
completely.

f4efafc5-365a-4c29-99ba-45ef68bf65bc-0
00:59:36.320 --> 00:59:39.031
Because if you have the appropriate
shielding systems,

f4efafc5-365a-4c29-99ba-45ef68bf65bc-1
00:59:39.031 --> 00:59:40.560
then that's actually a reality.

a9647488-278d-4aee-8af6-42486b642325-0
00:59:40.560 --> 00:59:44.200
And many people are now negotiating jobs
based upon what they have in their

a9647488-278d-4aee-8af6-42486b642325-1
00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:44.680
practices.

985f978a-400f-43a9-8f1c-995c156ec565-0
00:59:45.160 --> 00:59:48.317
I think it's important we didn't touch on
this to deal with mental Wellness and

985f978a-400f-43a9-8f1c-995c156ec565-1
00:59:48.317 --> 00:59:51.080
things like meditation as well,
because that allows you to be calmer.

b3c7ba07-534c-4a09-8bb5-09a581770d84-0
00:59:51.080 --> 00:59:54.672
That allows you to sort of reflect on
these things a little bit and take time

b3c7ba07-534c-4a09-8bb5-09a581770d84-1
00:59:54.672 --> 00:59:55.640
for yourself overall.

3f96eac4-2acd-430e-ae03-3dd062910576-0
00:59:55.840 --> 00:59:58.375
And in the end,
I just say do the things you enjoy and

3f96eac4-2acd-430e-ae03-3dd062910576-1
00:59:58.375 --> 01:00:01.509
relish those opportunities because the
road ahead, like in my case,

3f96eac4-2acd-430e-ae03-3dd062910576-2
01:00:01.509 --> 01:00:02.799
was bumpier than I expected.

0c43c48b-a034-480a-a421-d485af87daba-0
01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:04.000
And so I was out of Commission.

7718a2ac-2e7e-4ad6-9ffd-1b4751e61843-0
01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:04.680
I couldn't run.

120a8683-042f-4ada-be77-18c0a79fb4f7-0
01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:05.600
I couldn't do those things.

2aabe6a7-a5b5-43bd-9f9d-f6b9b11f15a8-0
01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:06.920
Fortunately, I'm now back.

30fac229-8c28-400f-9e89-567367276f6f-0
01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:09.746
I don't run anymore because of the
pounding on my back,

30fac229-8c28-400f-9e89-567367276f6f-1
01:00:09.746 --> 01:00:11.160
but I switched to bicycling.

7ed39447-8b58-4b9c-b32a-e9d7948e0b73-0
01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:14.160
And so it's really important to take care
of yourself.

7ab809f0-6c35-474a-be68-aea08ac3e1a1-0
01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:15.080
Hope you got something.

69c03be1-7c9c-4a70-bcce-bf639e8c9504-0
01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:17.800
Getting out of the talk and happy to take
any questions at this time.

6daa0b71-20a4-4fe0-8d6c-77c08261d5d9-0
01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:21.800
Great.

d960fb1b-909d-45d3-abab-6b5eee0dbbc4-0
01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:26.100
Welcome everybody to the Q&amp;
A session for session one scatter

d960fb1b-909d-45d3-abab-6b5eee0dbbc4-1
01:00:26.100 --> 01:00:30.400
radiation which you must know and those
were great presentations.

8f588133-bcfc-4cab-8d99-23b0554992e2-0
01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:36.936
We have a star-studded group of
interventionalists and physicists here to

8f588133-bcfc-4cab-8d99-23b0554992e2-1
01:00:36.936 --> 01:00:38.880
answer your questions.

caca843f-0cf1-48d6-8eb0-cdb0a5104ea1-0
01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:44.240
Be sure to ask your questions in the in
the question and answer tab.

f30c99ff-e449-4e14-bf4d-7c3c77d05ff9-0
01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:48.594
And also if you do you have any questions
that technical difficulties,

f30c99ff-e449-4e14-bf4d-7c3c77d05ff9-1
01:00:48.594 --> 01:00:53.027
there's a help desk there that you can
also ask ask for if you're having some

f30c99ff-e449-4e14-bf4d-7c3c77d05ff9-2
01:00:53.027 --> 01:00:53.879
issues with it.

0634f1a5-8105-45e5-ad37-a60b7a5829a7-0
01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:57.360
So wanted to introduce the group that's
with us here today.

b8cf7f00-5d01-49ab-a596-faba21b6f9f7-0
01:00:57.360 --> 01:01:00.520
First of all, my Co director,
Doctor Bella Howson.

4375b580-3cb3-4e21-9bae-2ad744a0c5c1-0
01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:04.887
So Bella,
I don't know if you want to say a few

4375b580-3cb3-4e21-9bae-2ad744a0c5c1-1
01:01:04.887 --> 01:01:09.800
words, sorry,
I'm I'm messing around with this sound.

a7b8a7e8-ab94-40df-863d-ff4c995c597b-0
01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:12.956
Hi everyone,
thank you for the introduction and thank

a7b8a7e8-ab94-40df-863d-ff4c995c597b-1
01:01:12.956 --> 01:01:14.360
you to all our speakers.

3b7f2c5f-e86e-4494-afc9-647f5f0550d3-0
01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:19.347
This is fantastic Big fan of anything
that will promote our health and

3b7f2c5f-e86e-4494-afc9-647f5f0550d3-1
01:01:19.347 --> 01:01:20.120
well-being.

1c57bb1e-f396-4016-a40b-5331318c2a95-0
01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:21.960
So thank you for joining us.

e4b394a5-9aca-4406-b6a0-72336910c32a-0
01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:25.040
And like Barbara said that we really do
want to interact.

ef3b88ab-8a3e-412e-a43d-64348d5f4d8c-0
01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:26.520
We want you guys to join.

0c8869a9-4c83-47a2-900a-2a11fad8ecae-0
01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:28.040
We want you to ask questions.

06f65484-2377-4aa0-8762-07b0a89d54ba-0
01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:30.960
So please there is no shame, No Fear here.

e83e105c-2559-4396-88b5-b421e42b9c99-0
01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:35.400
We are multinational faculty from all
over the world.

a42d76ce-ac04-4317-9cbd-4e4c2a777345-0
01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:38.464
So please,
even whatever region you're from,

a42d76ce-ac04-4317-9cbd-4e4c2a777345-1
01:01:38.464 --> 01:01:41.854
do not hesitate,
ask questions or share insights and,

a42d76ce-ac04-4317-9cbd-4e4c2a777345-2
01:01:41.854 --> 01:01:43.800
and let's, let's make a change.

345e3a16-7970-40af-9670-d8da577eca64-0
01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:46.120
Great.

9afec023-23dd-499f-94ef-8f41f77d22dc-0
01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:49.943
So the rest of the group,
I know you saw when they presented,

9afec023-23dd-499f-94ef-8f41f77d22dc-1
01:01:49.943 --> 01:01:54.938
but Doctor Rogers from Nottingham, he's a,
he's a medical physicist and original

9afec023-23dd-499f-94ef-8f41f77d22dc-2
01:01:54.938 --> 01:01:56.480
medical physicist expert.

2fbb149a-d153-4e14-9924-8cc85e939cb7-0
01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:59.800
We have Doctor Muck chief vascular
surgery in Ohio.

ea26553b-2832-48ea-a32f-70138c625cd5-0
01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:01.720
Doctor Gray was going to join us.

79ee6ae4-06d9-48cc-943d-b6786e643a36-0
01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:05.120
He gave a great presentation,
but he had to jump on the podium.

aa45eef9-2f80-40f0-a49a-0a9c033c7dc3-0
01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:06.600
So he's trying to time this right.

e8897bbd-8a67-4ebe-a7c3-597b2703b1b3-0
01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:09.040
Couldn't quite get it,
couldn't quite get it right with.

79088ba0-d297-4a54-8604-a9e988da129a-0
01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:11.720
But he's he's presenting additional data.

76c156f3-cd67-4a1a-bf79-41763bf6cfc0-0
01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:12.320
Elsewhere.

b99a69f6-fcbf-4e23-a9fc-2c76170afd02-0
01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:17.658
We have Lancer Smith,
who's also a health physicist and and

b99a69f6-fcbf-4e23-a9fc-2c76170afd02-1
01:02:17.658 --> 01:02:18.200
then Dr.

2434707c-f37f-40c5-9d08-e2fef84da1fd-0
01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:19.560
Curtain from Columbia.

fe1715b2-0fd5-49a2-a803-0a71086397da-0
01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:23.066
So so anyway,
I wanted to kind of throw it out there,

fe1715b2-0fd5-49a2-a803-0a71086397da-1
01:02:23.066 --> 01:02:25.995
I guess is,
is kind of the first thing and maybe

fe1715b2-0fd5-49a2-a803-0a71086397da-2
01:02:25.995 --> 01:02:30.178
Doctor Rogers, you can help,
but but what do you think is the kind of

fe1715b2-0fd5-49a2-a803-0a71086397da-3
01:02:30.178 --> 01:02:35.198
the most common knowledge gap that you're
seeing and trying to understand radiation

fe1715b2-0fd5-49a2-a803-0a71086397da-4
01:02:35.198 --> 01:02:39.381
of what you're seeing among
interventionalists and the staff in these

fe1715b2-0fd5-49a2-a803-0a71086397da-5
01:02:39.381 --> 01:02:39.680
labs?

4bd9b2bc-d0c1-416c-8994-55d0a49d7f5a-0
01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:45.160
I think there's two related things.

e5a72891-3f55-4a50-aa2b-000eb178f98c-0
01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:51.320
One is the issue of people don't want to
stand by the detector.

5593850e-66fb-435d-9b9a-bc868f92eeec-0
01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:53.598
When you're going into oblique
projections,

5593850e-66fb-435d-9b9a-bc868f92eeec-1
01:02:53.598 --> 01:02:57.535
which is when individuals are going to
receive the highest scattered doses,

5593850e-66fb-435d-9b9a-bc868f92eeec-2
01:02:57.535 --> 01:03:01.627
still think it's safest to stand by the
tube because they forget about most of

5593850e-66fb-435d-9b9a-bc868f92eeec-3
01:03:01.627 --> 01:03:03.440
it's coming backwards and sideways.

56c6e551-547d-403c-b866-64a9167af97b-0
01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:09.451
And then to top that off,
I think to be able to stand by the

56c6e551-547d-403c-b866-64a9167af97b-1
01:03:09.451 --> 01:03:13.094
detector,
you need to know which end is the

56c6e551-547d-403c-b866-64a9167af97b-2
01:03:13.094 --> 01:03:13.840
detector.

e19048aa-cbf8-44df-adb3-20b4240cda7e-0
01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:20.176
And I've seen a number of colleagues who
get confused as to which is the tube and

e19048aa-cbf8-44df-adb3-20b4240cda7e-1
01:03:20.176 --> 01:03:21.640
which is the detector.

8e1df864-aa00-44c8-87ad-d41e317e245a-0
01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:26.798
I think it's got a bit easier now with
the flat panels because we just say stand

8e1df864-aa00-44c8-87ad-d41e317e245a-1
01:03:26.798 --> 01:03:27.680
by the pizza box.

d83f4f4f-9ebb-41c2-b136-84c6242f64be-0
01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:31.653
But yeah, that that would be my,
my biggest thing,

d83f4f4f-9ebb-41c2-b136-84c6242f64be-1
01:03:31.653 --> 01:03:33.600
backwards scatter and forward scatter.

4f28e614-d9c4-4b4e-908a-875a9d805651-0
01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:39.120
And for those of us who for probably for
many years didn't realize what that what

4f28e614-d9c4-4b4e-908a-875a9d805651-1
01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:39.560
that was.

2ea48593-6be9-4899-8e39-1e3f531ec137-0
01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:43.250
Are there any systems where it comes from
the top or is it always coming from the

2ea48593-6be9-4899-8e39-1e3f531ec137-1
01:03:43.250 --> 01:03:46.445
bottom through the patient from the
bottom and then going to the image

2ea48593-6be9-4899-8e39-1e3f531ec137-2
01:03:46.445 --> 01:03:47.480
intensifier on the top?

f9b8cb24-240f-4095-b5f1-bce668bb92f3-0
01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:50.560
No,
it's not always coming from the bottom.

b6668fe4-7b22-4086-8cc6-4f21bdbd7960-0
01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:54.360
A lot of pediatric systems are over couch
tubes.

92a4d19d-fc65-4cef-9aca-287536bc9f48-0
01:03:55.400 --> 01:04:02.061
So they're the the saving grace there,
of course is Pediatrics or a lot thinner,

92a4d19d-fc65-4cef-9aca-287536bc9f48-1
01:04:02.061 --> 01:04:05.680
so the amount of radiation uses a lot
less.

437e1531-e25e-41b4-9c53-72aa108c1c75-0
01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:11.659
But in those scatter curves I showed,
you were roughly getting an order of

437e1531-e25e-41b4-9c53-72aa108c1c75-1
01:04:11.659 --> 01:04:17.480
magnitude difference between measurements
from the tube side to the detector side.

166cf2b3-bc0b-46d7-9200-91e67ac8aab1-0
01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:22.154
However, in real life,
it's probably more like a factor of 3 to

166cf2b3-bc0b-46d7-9200-91e67ac8aab1-1
01:04:22.154 --> 01:04:24.120
5, but it's still significant.

0d870429-0a17-411b-a98b-426dced9fd13-0
01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:28.640
And if we can reduce it,
we should be reducing it, right?

8b744741-cdbc-430e-84a1-ddf872454b78-0
01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:29.440
Great.

4b853621-ef31-4dc3-b8c3-2fc5b9584eb2-0
01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:29.840
Thank you.

e478e41a-c80c-42d8-9c93-0842747fd62f-0
01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:33.000
Doctor Muck had a question for you.

4aa07cb8-015d-4009-b8e8-75da839f8deb-0
01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:37.972
You know,
in your lab among vascular surgeons,

4aa07cb8-015d-4009-b8e8-75da839f8deb-1
01:04:37.972 --> 01:04:41.393
what do you see kind of this generation
and,

4aa07cb8-015d-4009-b8e8-75da839f8deb-2
01:04:41.393 --> 01:04:47.095
and even the understanding among vascular
surgeons regarding radiation and

4aa07cb8-015d-4009-b8e8-75da839f8deb-3
01:04:47.095 --> 01:04:48.920
understanding radiation?

95839608-ce0a-4113-af6b-f894823b2581-0
01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:49.760
What's the best way?

3914aca5-b0fd-401d-a2a1-047164909903-0
01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:52.880
I know in,
in cardiology we have obviously a big gap.

24c15885-9a13-422b-9767-8c5f7c0f2100-0
01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:57.248
I'm sure we have it in,
in vascular surgery and some of these

24c15885-9a13-422b-9767-8c5f7c0f2100-1
01:04:57.248 --> 01:04:58.400
other specialties.

e95ff173-882e-405a-b3d9-9cc9745fa878-0
01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:02.800
Probably radiology has the best graph on
graph on grip on radiation.

1b6d36e1-65ca-449a-81d5-ba3adb606971-0
01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:07.750
But but what are your,
what are the young surgeons thought

1b6d36e1-65ca-449a-81d5-ba3adb606971-1
01:05:07.750 --> 01:05:08.840
process there?

de3e57d3-de97-4fde-8a23-0a69bfc3220e-0
01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:10.880
And, and how do we bridge that gap?

d4ac7c24-e523-4f26-ae52-ff7f414ee0bd-0
01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:12.560
Yeah.

c28d520b-f7e6-41f3-8d81-61cf108f0ba5-0
01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:15.569
Well, first, Bob,
congratulations on that incredible

c28d520b-f7e6-41f3-8d81-61cf108f0ba5-1
01:05:15.569 --> 01:05:16.080
movement.

48e44386-c69d-481e-a416-7f0622f82220-0
01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:18.867
You know,
there's five regional societies of

48e44386-c69d-481e-a416-7f0622f82220-1
01:05:18.867 --> 01:05:19.920
vascular surgery.

1b23701f-5e47-46eb-98cc-51ca7ae8c5fd-0
01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:24.461
And I just came off my presidential
address that addressed this radiation

1b23701f-5e47-46eb-98cc-51ca7ae8c5fd-1
01:05:24.461 --> 01:05:28.756
mitigation on Friday and the number of
young folks, medical students,

1b23701f-5e47-46eb-98cc-51ca7ae8c5fd-2
01:05:28.756 --> 01:05:32.132
young residents,
junior faculty that came up to me and

1b23701f-5e47-46eb-98cc-51ca7ae8c5fd-3
01:05:32.132 --> 01:05:34.280
said thank you for addressing this.

3e6ea509-a5c2-41eb-b36b-06c63596e59b-0
01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:38.735
This is something that is always in the
back of our mind, but my generation,

3e6ea509-a5c2-41eb-b36b-06c63596e59b-1
01:05:38.735 --> 01:05:40.760
it's never really been in our mind.

bf51a75f-e942-46b4-abf5-f14a7b153b20-0
01:05:40.760 --> 01:05:44.643
And I look back at over the years,
you know, Landon, you know,

bf51a75f-e942-46b4-abf5-f14a7b153b20-1
01:05:44.643 --> 01:05:49.820
thoracic endographs that the left crowded
after doing some Clavian with the sea arm

bf51a75f-e942-46b4-abf5-f14a7b153b20-2
01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:52.040
put an ice bag on it to cool it off.

bb9693b4-b6e5-4266-9358-a8b3184c1c5a-0
01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:54.360
And I just think, what did I do to myself?

93f21702-cc01-4165-a11a-c047739433c0-0
01:05:54.800 --> 01:06:00.438
So I think that that the younger
generation is, is becoming aware,

93f21702-cc01-4165-a11a-c047739433c0-1
01:06:00.438 --> 01:06:05.320
they are super appreciative of what you
all have started.

9a7ed6cc-5e5a-4f31-874d-b67d61b7a7e2-0
01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:07.887
You know,
vascular surgery is way behind the other

9a7ed6cc-5e5a-4f31-874d-b67d61b7a7e2-1
01:06:07.887 --> 01:06:08.960
specialties with this.

af6f0c0b-1ac7-4b0e-8c07-7ac1ac97e4c6-0
01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:13.906
And I think we just need to continue to
get the word out via social media,

af6f0c0b-1ac7-4b0e-8c07-7ac1ac97e4c6-1
01:06:13.906 --> 01:06:17.640
Instagram for the youngsters X or Twitter
for my age group.

95db8632-1ddf-4e39-a6d0-7c97ed77532d-0
01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:21.145
But I,
I think we just need to continue social

95db8632-1ddf-4e39-a6d0-7c97ed77532d-1
01:06:21.145 --> 01:06:25.717
media posts showing that the cases that
we're doing with Rampart, in fact,

95db8632-1ddf-4e39-a6d0-7c97ed77532d-2
01:06:25.717 --> 01:06:29.252
is leading to, to,
to less radiation and better long term

95db8632-1ddf-4e39-a6d0-7c97ed77532d-3
01:06:29.252 --> 01:06:32.239
health for our, our youngsters,
without a doubt.

ff195a19-ccaa-4022-bf56-0ce789084682-0
01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:37.744
And don't forget the team members,
the RTS and the RNS who are doing 3 to 5,

ff195a19-ccaa-4022-bf56-0ce789084682-1
01:06:37.744 --> 01:06:41.840
the case 3 to 5X the number of cases that
we do each week.

b8c8f0ee-4d0b-48b0-93a8-10d0132657b0-0
01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:44.268
So again,
thanks so much for inviting me and an

b8c8f0ee-4d0b-48b0-93a8-10d0132657b0-1
01:06:44.268 --> 01:06:46.000
incredible job on raising awareness.

e4f77ca2-23e0-4d42-8f87-964a507ff12c-0
01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:48.520
Great, thank you.

654e1382-fd82-4617-a54c-88fc7bf270d8-0
01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:52.506
Have a couple more questions, Bella,
I don't know,

654e1382-fd82-4617-a54c-88fc7bf270d8-1
01:06:52.506 --> 01:06:55.000
I don't want to kind of haul the
conversation.

85d18732-e87f-4d4b-9432-bcb1fdacd3da-0
01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:58.360
If you think of a question then just just
pop right in.

e2436748-3e9a-49e3-8553-7509ac81cbce-0
01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:03.008
So if you, if you have one for anybody,
yeah, I think my question is,

e2436748-3e9a-49e3-8553-7509ac81cbce-1
01:07:03.008 --> 01:07:06.594
is to everybody,
what do you think the way forward in

e2436748-3e9a-49e3-8553-7509ac81cbce-2
01:07:06.594 --> 01:07:08.520
terms of bridging these gaps?

fdc35493-1760-41e1-865f-86942bc08984-0
01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:11.976
So I,
I know that some of the trainees have fed

fdc35493-1760-41e1-865f-86942bc08984-1
01:07:11.976 --> 01:07:16.800
back and they've suggested things like a
change to the curriculum.

6dfd4361-bc24-4ac4-8aca-e20453c8e25f-0
01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:22.085
So as, as it stands right now,
I am sure as we represent various

6dfd4361-bc24-4ac4-8aca-e20453c8e25f-1
01:07:22.085 --> 01:07:26.720
specialities,
I don't think most specialities have that.

62695bf2-9786-4eb4-a310-691c32a799fc-0
01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:29.240
It's not embedded in the curriculum.

66e8d26d-1028-43e5-8b50-877f48d66a7d-0
01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:32.247
I,
I know IR is a bit different because it's

66e8d26d-1028-43e5-8b50-877f48d66a7d-1
01:07:32.247 --> 01:07:35.589
heavily loaded on physical physics and
radiation,

66e8d26d-1028-43e5-8b50-877f48d66a7d-2
01:07:35.589 --> 01:07:40.000
but that's not necessarily adaptive to
everyday today procedures.

448b9dc8-83e5-4fb5-8a6c-7d0beb74f33b-0
01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:44.414
So just as a faculty as a whole, what,
where do you see where should we be going

448b9dc8-83e5-4fb5-8a6c-7d0beb74f33b-1
01:07:44.414 --> 01:07:44.920
with this?

f9df1e6f-e42d-4879-8050-1176d6310c54-0
01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:46.640
What, what are your thoughts and feelings?

f12720f2-de9a-4f01-922b-bebe6f9203d5-0
01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:50.200
What would be a productive way to go
forward with this?

61be3a36-9dbc-4088-abd0-f1fd9ee2762b-0
01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:52.080
You know, I'll start.

2b714d36-7e95-4dd9-9d0b-ac7e5212f126-0
01:07:52.520 --> 01:07:54.387
I,
I would just say that it's really

2b714d36-7e95-4dd9-9d0b-ac7e5212f126-1
01:07:54.387 --> 01:07:57.669
interesting to me that when often
radiation safety is discussed,

2b714d36-7e95-4dd9-9d0b-ac7e5212f126-2
01:07:57.669 --> 01:08:01.405
especially outside of radiology fields,
that's like the dry lecture where

2b714d36-7e95-4dd9-9d0b-ac7e5212f126-3
01:08:01.405 --> 01:08:03.676
everybody's like, oh man,
I have to hear my,

2b714d36-7e95-4dd9-9d0b-ac7e5212f126-4
01:08:03.676 --> 01:08:05.040
I have to take my medicine.

7ad05727-1da9-4159-8a94-27c4787c920e-0
01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:08.408
And that needs to just,
we have to accept that,

7ad05727-1da9-4159-8a94-27c4787c920e-1
01:08:08.408 --> 01:08:12.080
that that's what people think and then
somehow make it more accessible.

ae7b2088-a749-4b39-a0f0-60443ac80f21-0
01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:15.048
And that was one of the things I tried to
do with my talk, you know,

ae7b2088-a749-4b39-a0f0-60443ac80f21-1
01:08:15.048 --> 01:08:18.403
talking about a personal experience,
because it's one thing to see people who

ae7b2088-a749-4b39-a0f0-60443ac80f21-2
01:08:18.403 --> 01:08:21.930
are sort of in a generation above walking
around and talking about their injuries

ae7b2088-a749-4b39-a0f0-60443ac80f21-3
01:08:21.930 --> 01:08:22.920
and that kind of thing.

a0d0f55b-145c-4b1b-ba79-44530d2e69fb-0
01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:27.080
But if you see somebody that I guess
looks a little younger and you're sort of

a0d0f55b-145c-4b1b-ba79-44530d2e69fb-1
01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:30.292
say that could be me,
and then you see them talking about it

a0d0f55b-145c-4b1b-ba79-44530d2e69fb-2
01:08:30.292 --> 01:08:33.293
and doing it in a personalized,
clinically relevant way,

a0d0f55b-145c-4b1b-ba79-44530d2e69fb-3
01:08:33.293 --> 01:08:35.400
then I think it becomes more accessible.

c2ad2921-30e8-454f-8214-bb2d4feaf782-0
01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:37.760
I think from the educational standpoint,
it's remarkable.

7ad36944-034c-4e27-9cdc-0c6c4bc0c666-0
01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:40.193
Yesterday,
I had a colleague who actually has had

7ad36944-034c-4e27-9cdc-0c6c4bc0c666-1
01:08:40.193 --> 01:08:42.480
back issues,
and I was encouraging him to use,

7ad36944-034c-4e27-9cdc-0c6c4bc0c666-2
01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:44.767
you know,
radiation protection where he can go

7ad36944-034c-4e27-9cdc-0c6c4bc0c666-3
01:08:44.767 --> 01:08:46.519
leadless free or free, free of lead.

472763f0-3146-405d-8ca4-83f9efae691f-0
01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:48.080
And he was like,
I just got to get through this case.

a2a99b2a-068b-4dcc-9369-b4020e7c8fd3-0
01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:49.240
I just got to get through this case.

cf6f59e8-f559-4f22-8653-3052be58dbc5-0
01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:50.080
It's going to take too long.

e57f373c-6fd2-42f1-bd7c-5d9098a67e4d-0
01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:52.480
I was like, it doesn't take that long,
I'll set it up for you.

dfa302c8-e13e-4fe2-adef-78de0b8b8052-0
01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:53.360
It's like fast.

7eedf644-d0b3-4080-b449-57e9454c8a3a-0
01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:54.880
No, no,
it's going to get through the case.

488a194d-2723-4796-ad73-1d740a1c8508-0
01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:58.846
And so I think folks like that are not
going to be convincible unless something

488a194d-2723-4796-ad73-1d740a1c8508-1
01:08:58.846 --> 01:08:59.640
happens to them.

85fa157e-7e57-476c-b839-c691b5423165-0
01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:04.559
But the younger generation,
if they sort of see an effort being made

85fa157e-7e57-476c-b839-c691b5423165-1
01:09:04.559 --> 01:09:08.863
and they see it's easy and facile to do
part of the curriculum,

85fa157e-7e57-476c-b839-c691b5423165-2
01:09:08.863 --> 01:09:13.301
that would be a way forward,
do you think a way moving forward to

85fa157e-7e57-476c-b839-c691b5423165-3
01:09:13.301 --> 01:09:15.520
making certain things compulsory?

fd8f93b6-d9f2-40c0-b1fa-75a19587cc4f-0
01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:18.853
So, I mean, luckily,
none of us have lived through the days

fd8f93b6-d9f2-40c0-b1fa-75a19587cc4f-1
01:09:18.853 --> 01:09:23.132
where you would never operate without
washing hands and scrubbing adequately

fd8f93b6-d9f2-40c0-b1fa-75a19587cc4f-2
01:09:23.132 --> 01:09:25.743
and putting appropriate gear on where,
I mean,

fd8f93b6-d9f2-40c0-b1fa-75a19587cc4f-3
01:09:25.743 --> 01:09:30.077
should we be going into that kind of
compulsory phase of you shouldn't really

fd8f93b6-d9f2-40c0-b1fa-75a19587cc4f-4
01:09:30.077 --> 01:09:33.800
be doing what you're doing if you've not
got the appropriate gear?

8d6f951c-1a3f-462e-8df6-36bd4f8c5c75-0
01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:36.640
And then I guess this is more for Prof
Rogers.

5924237f-083b-4a03-bde1-99b77d436ff6-0
01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:39.480
What would should we be labeling as
appropriate?

028d4903-6da9-4b3c-b492-6603c3ed5e52-0
01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:43.187
We've had this discussion multiple times,
like you go to 1 hospital that's

028d4903-6da9-4b3c-b492-6603c3ed5e52-1
01:09:43.187 --> 01:09:45.511
appropriate for them,
you go another hospital,

028d4903-6da9-4b3c-b492-6603c3ed5e52-2
01:09:45.511 --> 01:09:49.120
exactly the same procedure is being done
and that is what's appropriate.

2135ec42-9412-441f-a909-313d1dbce016-0
01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:50.480
They are worlds apart.

0fd9c693-708b-4261-b8af-940e6dba4ce6-0
01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:52.600
So thoughts?

d6827bb1-be8f-4ea1-a9b5-ada3502d67d9-0
01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:54.360
Yeah, OK.

26cc7822-eba0-40ab-9196-509f61d66caa-0
01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:58.552
I'm not a great fan of mandatory this,
that and the other because you turn

26cc7822-eba0-40ab-9196-509f61d66caa-1
01:09:58.552 --> 01:09:59.320
everybody off.

19bbef30-1d0d-4e92-9e00-51ff39984a6f-0
01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:03.120
I think in terms of harmonizing the
access to protection,

19bbef30-1d0d-4e92-9e00-51ff39984a6f-1
01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:06.640
that's the role for the professional
bodies to set guidelines.

6c39cef6-0021-458c-b304-ac82c16260af-0
01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:12.200
In terms of education,
I have a lot of fear.

cb305c9b-140f-4c76-9f04-a86706cf588c-0
01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:13.920
I don't know how it's in the States.

d1e8ee5b-856a-4d36-93d1-95d774ac4d25-0
01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:18.080
Obviously,
IR is a specialty in its own right.

c27c81c6-1b92-4ea5-9ac2-85e919f30a86-0
01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:20.845
However,
I understand that the training can be

c27c81c6-1b92-4ea5-9ac2-85e919f30a86-1
01:10:20.845 --> 01:10:23.200
mixed between old school and new school.

2a68a93c-75d9-4528-81d1-8555da09b2c8-0
01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:29.213
And I feel even in the UK, Bella,
although we do a lot of physics and

2a68a93c-75d9-4528-81d1-8555da09b2c8-1
01:10:29.213 --> 01:10:31.920
radiation protection, it's generic.

8404fd8c-707e-46e8-ac02-0afb146c920d-0
01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:36.474
And I think the IRS,
when they go into the specialism,

8404fd8c-707e-46e8-ac02-0afb146c920d-1
01:10:36.474 --> 01:10:37.880
need bespoke training.

964070c1-772a-4ed9-a69c-50e36ffc3500-0
01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:41.464
And it needs to be,
as someone said it might have been AJ,

964070c1-772a-4ed9-a69c-50e36ffc3500-1
01:10:41.464 --> 01:10:42.680
clinically relevant.

7b508d11-cef1-4b6c-90bc-d726e5378f2c-0
01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:45.840
And it needs to be more accessible,
more fun.

cf9bea0e-680a-498c-98e5-3872a3826814-0
01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:49.813
And people like myself,
and I'm sure Lancer would agree with this

cf9bea0e-680a-498c-98e5-3872a3826814-1
01:10:49.813 --> 01:10:51.920
is we've got to make it accessible.

8b99339e-6b1d-4627-9036-4c94839ee494-0
01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:55.720
It's no good standing there droning on
like this.

cf1f9c6b-1007-41e9-8bb8-7ff54423f646-0
01:10:56.120 --> 01:10:58.000
It's not going to grab anyone's attention.

ec3c0562-5697-4cb7-bcd3-12326276ca63-0
01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:03.285
You have to have some key grabbable
messages that really get people's

ec3c0562-5697-4cb7-bcd3-12326276ca63-1
01:11:03.285 --> 01:11:04.040
attention.

f416292f-b8ce-4acd-a5be-d8c7fd125c2e-0
01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:06.640
So I think it's style.

5ad8cdbd-6888-418e-a2d6-cfb0f6bf44fa-0
01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:10.920
It's with our online courses for the
cardiologist and the vascular surgeon.

8ca44573-35fd-46ce-a918-adfd068c0943-0
01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:14.680
My fear is they do it in a darkened room
with no help whatsoever.

b1519da0-fdf4-4d0b-84b8-576aea7599f4-0
01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:20.040
How is that knowledge going to be
translated into clinical practice?

3ba20441-7f0d-4c66-adcb-8aa916e4aa82-0
01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:22.200
Are they really going to translate that?

8d748818-f042-48a3-8bf9-5e07a9f9670e-0
01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:26.407
So I see there's a real need for a more
holistic,

8d748818-f042-48a3-8bf9-5e07a9f9670e-1
01:11:26.407 --> 01:11:31.640
all round multidisciplinary approach to
this to change the culture.

c793ac65-037e-4a23-a8b2-99032777ce1e-0
01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:33.960
And that's why I was really pleased this
week.

43967d17-c01f-4938-968c-7efbb024a43a-0
01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:39.332
I had a call between the radiographers
and BSIR to talk about actually doing

43967d17-c01f-4938-968c-7efbb024a43a-1
01:11:39.332 --> 01:11:44.494
this and coming up with some guidelines
around education and training and

43967d17-c01f-4938-968c-7efbb024a43a-2
01:11:44.494 --> 01:11:45.960
radiation protection.

bf842e97-4940-4590-b6c0-756d4067da88-0
01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:49.880
But the guidelines the the delivery will
be up to the local.

429cabfe-71d4-4415-91b8-f2de6194eb13-0
01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:52.560
So I hope that answers your question.

65144968-3b9d-4a2c-9066-0e9d639e604d-0
01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:55.400
I was just going to real quickly say I
fully agree.

356c82d5-b817-4f65-80f1-eb6bbb4c1372-0
01:11:55.400 --> 01:11:57.600
I think that too many rules and people
rebel.

83031ed8-d7e3-48ee-8d9b-2d855108f61b-0
01:11:57.600 --> 01:12:01.129
But I think if you can appeal to people's
common sense, so for instance,

83031ed8-d7e3-48ee-8d9b-2d855108f61b-1
01:12:01.129 --> 01:12:04.127
if you don't want to use the full
shielding system, you know,

83031ed8-d7e3-48ee-8d9b-2d855108f61b-2
01:12:04.127 --> 01:12:06.931
you can at least standardize using the
abdominal Shields,

83031ed8-d7e3-48ee-8d9b-2d855108f61b-3
01:12:06.931 --> 01:12:09.301
whether you're going to use that,
whatever case,

83031ed8-d7e3-48ee-8d9b-2d855108f61b-4
01:12:09.301 --> 01:12:10.800
that is a standard thing to do.

d9804893-f9b4-4b66-9227-c81b1ba59646-0
01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:13.483
And if you appeal to the staff saying,
hey, you want to protect yourselves,

d9804893-f9b4-4b66-9227-c81b1ba59646-1
01:12:13.483 --> 01:12:14.720
why wouldn't you just put these in?

da7b7286-d7af-4445-999e-a83d5df3447b-0
01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:19.771
That's a reasonable way to proceed,
I think in terms of some of the questions

da7b7286-d7af-4445-999e-a83d5df3447b-1
01:12:19.771 --> 01:12:22.952
in the chat, you know,
the dosimetry question is a,

da7b7286-d7af-4445-999e-a83d5df3447b-2
01:12:22.952 --> 01:12:24.360
is a perennial bugbear.

96f48ced-c1ad-4473-983b-b9765f9cd7e9-0
01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:27.280
I think at some point it does have to
have some teeth.

b0d15d6e-b646-4960-85ae-d50b7569969e-0
01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:29.920
There need to be ramifications if you
don't do it.

7fa61499-93d5-4bd9-ad6e-6cf7bbfa28ee-0
01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:31.553
There's certain people who respond to
carrots,

7fa61499-93d5-4bd9-ad6e-6cf7bbfa28ee-1
01:12:31.553 --> 01:12:32.840
certain people who respond to sticks.

e0027645-c585-4edd-8e18-53e59b5e6e65-0
01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:35.680
You have to appeal broadly to both of
those constituencies.

c971586e-3225-4f61-af9b-9bcb23edd08e-0
01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:36.960
And so that's kind of important.

ab9fe2c8-5e87-41b0-bfed-3468b598ddde-0
01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:41.586
And then the final piece with respect to
protecting everyone in the room,

ab9fe2c8-5e87-41b0-bfed-3468b598ddde-1
01:12:41.586 --> 01:12:45.640
every system you get has to be somewhat
addressing that whole issue.

7b1bb9a6-2c96-4461-b694-9021364ab0f9-0
01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:49.637
And if you get everybody to buy into the
philosophy, we're protecting everybody,

7b1bb9a6-2c96-4461-b694-9021364ab0f9-1
01:12:49.637 --> 01:12:53.685
then it's more likely that you're going
to get pulled through with any individual

7b1bb9a6-2c96-4461-b694-9021364ab0f9-2
01:12:53.685 --> 01:12:54.080
therapy.

35bbc257-e89e-494c-8625-7ca9edc33081-0
01:12:57.880 --> 01:12:58.360
Very good.

e0097b25-0d4d-4109-acdb-870d03495b1a-0
01:12:58.520 --> 01:12:59.880
We've got about two minutes left.

7f825c79-7dc7-4a4f-8f95-d43706ae6f58-0
01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:03.560
I did want to bring Lancer in here just
to kind of ask him.

64ce1869-1e85-4779-9ee8-a7af0fbb3ce0-0
01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:06.160
You know,
we talked about these real time asymmetry.

968a5d4a-58b7-49bb-a4d1-be852aae20e1-0
01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:08.744
And,
and I think it's a it's a great idea

968a5d4a-58b7-49bb-a4d1-be852aae20e1-1
01:13:08.744 --> 01:13:12.748
because I think it does modify your
behavior in the lab if you know what

968a5d4a-58b7-49bb-a4d1-be852aae20e1-2
01:13:12.748 --> 01:13:14.120
you're getting real time.

81ff1582-2e23-4e72-84e6-8566364fe2c9-0
01:13:14.120 --> 01:13:16.757
And I mean,
I practiced almost 30 years and,

81ff1582-2e23-4e72-84e6-8566364fe2c9-1
01:13:16.757 --> 01:13:21.386
and didn't really know what I was getting
with certain procedures or whatever,

81ff1582-2e23-4e72-84e6-8566364fe2c9-2
01:13:21.386 --> 01:13:24.200
because we never had anything really real
time.

aa942213-e691-489b-847a-46823c80bc25-0
01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:27.000
Do you feel like that people engaged?

db3723c1-3452-4461-ace4-78fd491e2b54-0
01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:30.293
I know that at least here in the US,
there's a big issue with people even

db3723c1-3452-4461-ace4-78fd491e2b54-1
01:13:30.293 --> 01:13:32.920
wearing the badges because they're
exceeding their limits.

beff29a0-d98a-4893-b774-b0b428b0f085-0
01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:35.120
And so they still want to try to stay in
the lab.

e4505c14-8d43-4e65-9d51-7ea03615f27d-0
01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:38.493
And so,
so are we going to have the same problem

e4505c14-8d43-4e65-9d51-7ea03615f27d-1
01:13:38.493 --> 01:13:43.222
with real time dissymmetry where where
people are are wearing them for a short

e4505c14-8d43-4e65-9d51-7ea03615f27d-2
01:13:43.222 --> 01:13:44.120
period of time?

f0cf60c7-68b4-4834-8c44-4c933f7a40a2-0
01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:46.320
And then they, they just said, yeah,
I'm good.

5d91a584-d91b-42b3-be15-e9696301bf2b-0
01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:47.280
What do you think?

df991581-3ae4-4886-a18e-299a59c74789-0
01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:50.132
And,
and how do we kind of promote that really

df991581-3ae4-4886-a18e-299a59c74789-1
01:13:50.132 --> 01:13:50.680
important?

ccfc0605-56ab-420a-a174-35cabcabb08b-0
01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:53.800
Yeah,
I think that's a really good question.

05db0e3c-f0fb-484b-87a6-7565ea44b8b1-0
01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:58.970
I think the the real benefit with real
time DOS symmetry, you know, technologies,

05db0e3c-f0fb-484b-87a6-7565ea44b8b1-1
01:13:58.970 --> 01:14:03.065
technologies just advance so much from
our old school detectors where we would

05db0e3c-f0fb-484b-87a6-7565ea44b8b1-2
01:14:03.065 --> 01:14:07.159
just wear them and we don't know what the
readings are months into the future.

9b95e85d-073a-4a61-8f26-80fb22c52864-0
01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:12.169
The real time DOS symmetry,
the fact that it gives you that feedback

9b95e85d-073a-4a61-8f26-80fb22c52864-1
01:14:12.169 --> 01:14:15.525
immediately,
it lets you make immediate changes and it

9b95e85d-073a-4a61-8f26-80fb22c52864-2
01:14:15.525 --> 01:14:20.284
also lets you know what you're doing that
is causing that high dose rate that

9b95e85d-073a-4a61-8f26-80fb22c52864-3
01:14:20.284 --> 01:14:21.200
you're getting.

5a4c4631-bc18-4ff9-84bf-59ed21424ad6-0
01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:25.611
So if you if you find out that when
you're running, for example,

5a4c4631-bc18-4ff9-84bf-59ed21424ad6-1
01:14:25.611 --> 01:14:30.610
sin A and you see your real time dose
symmetries, just start going off the roof,

5a4c4631-bc18-4ff9-84bf-59ed21424ad6-2
01:14:30.610 --> 01:14:33.758
you know,
going going through the ceiling on that,

5a4c4631-bc18-4ff9-84bf-59ed21424ad6-3
01:14:33.758 --> 01:14:37.585
you could learn that, oh,
that's the moment that I'm actually

5a4c4631-bc18-4ff9-84bf-59ed21424ad6-4
01:14:37.585 --> 01:14:39.560
getting those really high doses.

8e836918-fb06-480b-8b1d-be9ebf7a6a71-0
01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:44.748
Maybe I should step back two or three
feet from the table when I'm running sin

8e836918-fb06-480b-8b1d-be9ebf7a6a71-1
01:14:44.748 --> 01:14:48.255
A and you notice that your dose drops
because you know,

8e836918-fb06-480b-8b1d-be9ebf7a6a71-2
01:14:48.255 --> 01:14:53.078
exposure follows the inverse square law,
which mathematically just means you

8e836918-fb06-480b-8b1d-be9ebf7a6a71-3
01:14:53.078 --> 01:14:55.960
double the distance you drop the dose by
1/4.

ae8bf7c7-4515-4bc1-b00f-5ee06532bf3e-0
01:14:55.960 --> 01:14:58.720
So it's a huge exponential reduction just
by distance.

2dd59186-ef42-4fc0-b38d-cfeff48f24ee-0
01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:03.269
So you can kind of like pick up on
certain things like that with your real

2dd59186-ef42-4fc0-b38d-cfeff48f24ee-1
01:15:03.269 --> 01:15:04.280
time dose symmetry.

2ea1427f-fa4f-414e-98c7-32d42a75418a-0
01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:07.520
You might also find out that you're using
that overhead shield completely wrong.

5b3447f9-91b0-4d37-9c8f-d2e4069114c1-0
01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:11.888
You might find out that if you place it
just a little bit different or you know,

5b3447f9-91b0-4d37-9c8f-d2e4069114c1-1
01:15:11.888 --> 01:15:15.988
there's just a series of things that you
can learn from that real time dose

5b3447f9-91b0-4d37-9c8f-d2e4069114c1-2
01:15:15.988 --> 01:15:18.361
symmetry,
which I think also goes into that

5b3447f9-91b0-4d37-9c8f-d2e4069114c1-3
01:15:18.361 --> 01:15:22.460
education piece we were talking about
earlier where if you just improve the

5b3447f9-91b0-4d37-9c8f-d2e4069114c1-4
01:15:22.460 --> 01:15:26.128
education and that that's,
I can't think of a better way to educate

5b3447f9-91b0-4d37-9c8f-d2e4069114c1-5
01:15:26.128 --> 01:15:30.119
yourself on your radiation exposure than
getting that real time feedback.

32cf8483-d8a1-4099-9bfb-8fa10ea818ae-0
01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:34.040
And honestly,
it should just reduce your dose.

d0397bfb-a2d9-4099-90c2-590b878a2368-0
01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:38.308
It might make you feel more confident
we're going to dosimeter dosimeter and

d0397bfb-a2d9-4099-90c2-590b878a2368-1
01:15:38.308 --> 01:15:42.023
you hopefully won't be reaching your
annual dose limits, you know,

d0397bfb-a2d9-4099-90c2-590b878a2368-2
01:15:42.023 --> 01:15:46.680
earlier in the year if you're using that
at the same time as your normal dosimeter.

cef3373c-5b81-4c0e-99b0-5cc30addd94a-0
01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:48.320
Well, great.

0936ba60-d9bc-40b2-ae98-ba9aae58ffb7-0
01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:49.640
Well, that's a huge help.

ab3df19b-59d6-4e3a-9e21-1e58a14c87f1-0
01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:52.360
But we're going to go on to the next
session.

61615a99-f63c-4b7b-9598-17e6bfb52be1-0
01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:56.920
I appreciate everyone that that spoke
everyone with this round table.

867cb8a8-a31a-47b2-870d-5d7dcff474f6-0
01:15:57.160 --> 01:15:59.320
There are quite a few questions in the
chat.

161fadd2-8fd8-40b3-bb38-247317d049fb-0
01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:02.536
What we'll do is we'll be able to
incorporate those in some of the round

161fadd2-8fd8-40b3-bb38-247317d049fb-1
01:16:02.536 --> 01:16:06.194
tables toward the end of the day or or it
at the end of the discussions of some of

161fadd2-8fd8-40b3-bb38-247317d049fb-2
01:16:06.194 --> 01:16:07.120
these other sessions.

f8846c44-809f-479a-ba47-b32db2fdb43e-0
01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:10.800
So so we will take those into account and
bring those back to you.

7bbdde94-817b-4acc-b4b9-cad93c2987e2-0
01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:12.560
Please join us now.

83f3f795-9fcf-43f7-a575-9440a7df1c29-0
01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:15.655
We have a,
a non CME innovation theatre entitled

83f3f795-9fcf-43f7-a575-9440a7df1c29-1
01:16:15.655 --> 01:16:19.383
Shedding shed, the lead total body,
total team protection,

83f3f795-9fcf-43f7-a575-9440a7df1c29-2
01:16:19.383 --> 01:16:23.995
transforming interventional lab safety
with evidence innovation and team

83f3f795-9fcf-43f7-a575-9440a7df1c29-3
01:16:23.995 --> 01:16:24.880
centered care.

f7be76eb-3ebb-4362-8fc4-1cbbf0ef5b92-0
01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:28.080
So we'll return back to general session
at 11:50.

d6a37690-d285-44be-8fbc-4fe5e6d598da-0
01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:28.600
Thank you.

9d0bccaa-0cd2-4dd5-8ed1-ad6e23cf1fe8-0
01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:30.080
Thank you.
