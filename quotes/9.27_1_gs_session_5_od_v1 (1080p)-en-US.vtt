00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.614
Hi everyone,
thank you for joining me today to talk

980327e8-2a51-448f-b02b-2ba77f78a503-1
00:00:04.614 --> 00:00:10.047
about a few important issues,
especially if you are a female in this

980327e8-2a51-448f-b02b-2ba77f78a503-2
00:00:10.047 --> 00:00:10.520
field.

021c3295-a753-4a4d-b5e5-101fe0136393-0
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.930
My name is Bella,
I'm one of the doctors in endovascular

021c3295-a753-4a4d-b5e5-101fe0136393-1
00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:15.360
and interventional radiology.

9895b33e-3837-49cf-9168-509dd09e8211-0
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.960
I am from the UK era but all over the
place at the moment.

46f06083-460f-4207-89b3-6c08ff3e99e7-0
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.760
These are my disclosures over the last
few years.

2fc27746-c0d0-4bac-90d8-0d23d42661ae-0
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.560
So endovascular, what does that mean?

bc8fe369-129d-48ae-bfde-4ec8b00fba14-0
00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:30.480
What is this field?

7bec79cc-4a1f-4f06-be6a-1a4b9034450a-0
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.216
Certainly when I was training,
I have to admit that I hadn't come across

7bec79cc-4a1f-4f06-be6a-1a4b9034450a-1
00:00:35.216 --> 00:00:37.200
it and I didn't know much about it.

ce7a4bb0-87d6-4929-bfe8-3d9aa13ed5c9-0
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.280
I happened to stumble on it by accident
during my surgical training.

870c5808-c8e6-42c1-9627-87da6c18f989-0
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.054
It's important to realize that
endovascular is practically almost

870c5808-c8e6-42c1-9627-87da6c18f989-1
00:00:47.054 --> 00:00:51.335
everybody part is involved and we are
lucky that in time we have sub

870c5808-c8e6-42c1-9627-87da6c18f989-2
00:00:51.335 --> 00:00:52.080
specialized.

258cab63-ab1e-469c-ac26-b14e7a080540-0
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.036
So you wouldn't necessarily be doing
everything,

258cab63-ab1e-469c-ac26-b14e7a080540-1
00:00:55.036 --> 00:00:59.200
but you will have some basic
understanding of most of these regions.

b3c1710a-73ed-4c34-9df1-6ac2d1c27b9e-0
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.200
So for me personally, I do peripheral,
which is from the carotid down.

a16e27d9-6b38-4a73-bec8-1b4da087b165-0
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.235
I don't personally get involved in the
neurovascular though some people would

a16e27d9-6b38-4a73-bec8-1b4da087b165-1
00:01:08.235 --> 00:01:10.760
say carotid treatment is this part of the
algorithm.

f901ddf1-a65d-4500-b033-cfe01b9066eb-0
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.964
Some people would only be purely working
on the heart,

f901ddf1-a65d-4500-b033-cfe01b9066eb-1
00:01:13.964 --> 00:01:15.480
so interventional cardiologists.

add789c3-a7ea-4a58-988c-2c41e9d68a73-0
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.592
But even within that branch,
you will find that some will do

add789c3-a7ea-4a58-988c-2c41e9d68a73-1
00:01:18.592 --> 00:01:22.360
peripheral vascular work like like what
Some may be involved in pulmonary work.

3b621d75-ebe4-4bbb-8511-861e80466968-0
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.520
And in some countries you will find some
people doing multiple regions.

9c62eed7-e937-47eb-855d-9f82b1be3a98-0
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.320
So they will be able to do neurovascular
as well as peripheral vascular.

1d3feff7-fc5d-439b-aa43-e8de59377f6c-0
00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.120
So it's not limited for certainty.

b50336c0-5339-4b63-a59a-9d11a71f4131-0
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.299
And whilst we may call ourselves,
for example,

b50336c0-5339-4b63-a59a-9d11a71f4131-1
00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:39.431
peripheral vascular adventures
neurovascular,

b50336c0-5339-4b63-a59a-9d11a71f4131-2
00:01:39.431 --> 00:01:41.240
it doesn't mean that that's all you do.

2c87ea51-0716-4e42-932b-836947ce46b1-0
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.154
It may be that in the country that you
are, based on your training scheme,

2c87ea51-0716-4e42-932b-836947ce46b1-1
00:01:45.154 --> 00:01:46.720
you do a few of these regions.

13c23c83-02b1-4936-9867-f45052eb2f2a-0
00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.227
And it's,
it's a wonderful thing because the more

13c23c83-02b1-4936-9867-f45052eb2f2a-1
00:01:50.227 --> 00:01:53.920
you can do, the more you can understand,
the more you can help and save people.

eca35a11-9c25-40a2-9111-790322d15a1d-0
00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.732
So this is basically more based on the UK
system of how many of us have reached the

eca35a11-9c25-40a2-9111-790322d15a1d-1
00:02:01.732 --> 00:02:04.240
stages and the training that we have.

5d2f8220-2bcc-47a8-a019-375059ffc720-0
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.096
Of course,
if you are based in a different country,

5d2f8220-2bcc-47a8-a019-375059ffc720-1
00:02:07.096 --> 00:02:08.560
this is not applicable to you.

1e798101-4fba-4179-8cc8-fe23e4fbd846-0
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.987
But in essence,
most people would go through medical

1e798101-4fba-4179-8cc8-fe23e4fbd846-1
00:02:11.987 --> 00:02:16.440
school and through medical school they
will get into some speciality training.

6cf2cf9f-e483-4d5b-a80f-e663e6230ffe-0
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.233
Some people in some countries would have
direct access to their interventional

6cf2cf9f-e483-4d5b-a80f-e663e6230ffe-1
00:02:22.233 --> 00:02:22.680
career.

dd937030-9841-477d-b8c4-9e8733f70ea4-0
00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.720
Others, like for myself,
when I was training,

dd937030-9841-477d-b8c4-9e8733f70ea4-1
00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.651
you had to do other cool training prior
to coming into interventional radiology,

dd937030-9841-477d-b8c4-9e8733f70ea4-2
00:02:30.651 --> 00:02:35.095
through radiology and I was in the
surgical pathway and then came across

dd937030-9841-477d-b8c4-9e8733f70ea4-3
00:02:35.095 --> 00:02:36.800
that's not the case anymore.

ece8c70c-0828-4008-a960-de27c6f5ae6a-0
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.481
I think most people would be able to go
directly through into cardiology,

ece8c70c-0828-4008-a960-de27c6f5ae6a-1
00:02:40.481 --> 00:02:43.417
through into neuro,
through into interventional radiology,

ece8c70c-0828-4008-a960-de27c6f5ae6a-2
00:02:43.417 --> 00:02:44.960
whichever interventional field.

9d1dcdaa-a789-4cc7-97b2-396cec6a9e79-0
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.736
I don't think the process involves that
you have to go elsewhere prior to this

9d1dcdaa-a789-4cc7-97b2-396cec6a9e79-1
00:02:49.736 --> 00:02:50.160
though.

9887a59d-25d4-4c90-8de5-8a71127dc04f-0
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.895
I wouldn't say this is a bad thing if you
did go elsewhere prior to coming to your

9887a59d-25d4-4c90-8de5-8a71127dc04f-1
00:02:53.895 --> 00:02:54.480
chosen field.

89699dab-1550-4bb4-8716-c279ce5c7722-0
00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.760
The more you do,
the more you know and you're aware.

90053f6c-fabd-4283-8a62-31edbc2c3c5f-0
00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.360
And then of course after your basic
training you can go on to do other things.

3018dbbd-8c21-4da1-bac6-2e642a03a85c-0
00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.280
This career is not limited to just
clinical work.

a2efc07e-74ec-40c9-8407-62124b794ba9-0
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.360
You can go on to do different master's
degree.

3e5e48b4-6f5f-4b8b-976f-5ebc2b87fd48-0
00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.406
I have colleagues who've done philosophy,
I have colleagues who have interests in

3e5e48b4-6f5f-4b8b-976f-5ebc2b87fd48-1
00:03:12.406 --> 00:03:14.760
leadership and management who have gone
on to the MBAs.

95c57049-e8d1-40a6-9eb2-bfe6fa929796-0
00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.340
So I've evolved in military work,
charity work and sort of have nothing

95c57049-e8d1-40a6-9eb2-bfe6fa929796-1
00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.000
absolutely to do with the career.

456d3b32-e561-4b0d-a79c-0d01ecc2cebc-0
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.240
Like landscape gardening.

9bd56432-d7a3-44a6-a878-fe0f469aa0de-0
00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.360
I thought the world is your oyster.

6d0363df-c79a-45c0-a339-b3773b8dd816-0
00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.640
And so this is again a summary of the
main pathways.

adffd2d0-7370-4977-b5c0-5665afa5af9b-0
00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.880
Like I said, it's not the only pathway.

57d8c922-e907-4d92-ad40-983687c2219d-0
00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.312
And if you are in a particular country,
you may find for example,

57d8c922-e907-4d92-ad40-983687c2219d-1
00:03:35.312 --> 00:03:37.860
you have gone through medicine,
you are a renal,

57d8c922-e907-4d92-ad40-983687c2219d-2
00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.020
you've gone into nephrology and in fact
you do interventional work like fistula

57d8c922-e907-4d92-ad40-983687c2219d-3
00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.280
work.

041c02bd-b103-4bf9-bdac-4b6f6366176e-0
00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.800
So again, the world is your oyster.

fcc2ca76-58c7-4d45-ae1e-cf888edfb7d0-0
00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.840
I don't want to completely say this is
the only way you will get to a place.

8fbc00f5-7395-405e-bf36-b9693cc7dc40-0
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.062
Just understand the scheme that you're in
or the way you're intended to work and

8fbc00f5-7395-405e-bf36-b9693cc7dc40-1
00:03:54.062 --> 00:03:56.200
find out the pathway that gets you there.

9f12de7f-523d-49ab-bf23-e80f23f6695f-0
00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.823
So without, you know, being sexist,
a lot of this stuff is,

9f12de7f-523d-49ab-bf23-e80f23f6695f-1
00:04:02.823 --> 00:04:04.240
is not just for women.

bc62c514-8ee1-4907-82e6-f9e163521555-0
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:09.793
It's it's really for everybody to say
there is a lot of myths out there and we

bc62c514-8ee1-4907-82e6-f9e163521555-1
00:04:09.793 --> 00:04:11.200
need to debunk them.

d1bb3f94-fde6-43e3-b138-10cce3799bb8-0
00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.710
But for women in particular,
because we have a set of role that nature

d1bb3f94-fde6-43e3-b138-10cce3799bb8-1
00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:18.520
has given us that doesn't apply to
anybody else.

a6bd7efa-370b-4005-9a0b-c5aefc9e3158-0
00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.160
And sometimes that can also come in the
way of being a doctor.

e6181463-076a-4f32-82f0-99a27767afbd-0
00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.768
So in essence,
there are fewer women the higher up you

e6181463-076a-4f32-82f0-99a27767afbd-1
00:04:26.768 --> 00:04:31.199
go in most of the fields,
but it's more apparent in surgery and

e6181463-076a-4f32-82f0-99a27767afbd-2
00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:33.000
indovascular intervention.

5ab0fd9c-33f3-4fbd-862c-ef211844fe94-0
00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.336
So you'll see less females, for example,
senior roles,

5ab0fd9c-33f3-4fbd-862c-ef211844fe94-1
00:04:37.336 --> 00:04:41.759
whether it's interventional cardiology,
radiology surgery, they're,

5ab0fd9c-33f3-4fbd-862c-ef211844fe94-2
00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:42.799
they're on less.

becae03b-0929-47c9-b64f-f2ed87d4f0fa-0
00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.149
I think that will change with time
because we're certainly seeing a lot more

becae03b-0929-47c9-b64f-f2ed87d4f0fa-1
00:04:47.149 --> 00:04:49.160
trainees, a lot more junior consultants.

ed4dcf84-1e5d-4327-a373-9f89676a0853-0
00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.324
So with time,
hopefully you'll see more in leadership

ed4dcf84-1e5d-4327-a373-9f89676a0853-1
00:04:52.324 --> 00:04:54.200
roles or certainly higher roles.

0361a6ad-fbb9-4abc-b07b-4780db27f8b0-0
00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:55.440
But why?

6946da6a-9629-4a31-b76c-2e7a34411143-0
00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.360
Why is that?

7e6e6b16-c7a8-43ff-99c6-7ead24ac4aa3-0
00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.394
So a few of the myths that come across is
because all all females are just scared

7e6e6b16-c7a8-43ff-99c6-7ead24ac4aa3-1
00:05:01.394 --> 00:05:05.551
of radiation and therefore they don't go
into this field or there's absolutely

7e6e6b16-c7a8-43ff-99c6-7ead24ac4aa3-2
00:05:05.551 --> 00:05:06.919
poor run through training.

b1825a4e-c30a-47a2-86ce-0197e1ce76e4-0
00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.480
So they don't want to waste their time.

570e25b5-782d-4a91-8e8c-0c11843fe204-0
00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.440
There are no role models and therefore
can't go into that.

fc128a00-e46b-4374-a649-c16528fd5ee0-0
00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.120
And there's absolutely like no work life
balance.

2c3948fe-c336-449d-ab93-85dce06ef3a3-0
00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.272
The reality is,
is that a lot of these myths can be

2c3948fe-c336-449d-ab93-85dce06ef3a3-1
00:05:18.272 --> 00:05:19.560
applied to almost every job.

2a51744c-17e9-4c66-917c-4c06b5ebbff1-0
00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.129
Even if you wanted to be a lawyer,
you could say, you know,

2a51744c-17e9-4c66-917c-4c06b5ebbff1-1
00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:27.590
there's a lack of dominant high up female
figures and models and poor work

2a51744c-17e9-4c66-917c-4c06b5ebbff1-2
00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.160
lifestyle balance,
but that could really be applied anyway.

01237b49-edb1-4b22-8741-2b7e8c183bdb-0
00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.901
But let's try and debunk as many of them
as possible and give you a bit of

01237b49-edb1-4b22-8741-2b7e8c183bdb-1
00:05:34.901 --> 00:05:35.600
understanding.

9180c79a-4286-4cb7-8a8c-5a4f710221ad-0
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.080
Again, whilst it's, it's more for women,
it's not specific for women.

3b188809-3a3c-4b82-9f03-f950b937c40b-0
00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.751
I mean,
life work balance is important for

3b188809-3a3c-4b82-9f03-f950b937c40b-1
00:05:42.751 --> 00:05:45.360
everybody as well as radiation protection.

e8d63219-2fc6-4f10-b00b-11f27f413801-0
00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:50.927
So these are the concerns specific to our
interventional field because whether

e8d63219-2fc6-4f10-b00b-11f27f413801-1
00:05:50.927 --> 00:05:54.692
you're doing interventional cardiology or
interventional neuro,

e8d63219-2fc6-4f10-b00b-11f27f413801-2
00:05:54.692 --> 00:05:58.870
you are having to use fluoroscopy,
which means you are in contact with

e8d63219-2fc6-4f10-b00b-11f27f413801-3
00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:01.929
radiation,
which means that you are in contact with

e8d63219-2fc6-4f10-b00b-11f27f413801-4
00:06:01.929 --> 00:06:02.400
scatter.

b040efe8-699f-41cf-bd97-d2869e9b0cac-0
00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.520
So that's what makes this particular
niche important.

3fb60ab0-9160-498e-ae92-9bbdf071be7e-0
00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.905
There is a lot of lack of data and
evidence, like if we were to look at,

3fb60ab0-9160-498e-ae92-9bbdf071be7e-1
00:06:10.905 --> 00:06:13.842
for example,
my field stenosis or management of

3fb60ab0-9160-498e-ae92-9bbdf071be7e-2
00:06:13.842 --> 00:06:16.840
stenosis,
there'll be all sorts of data that you

3fb60ab0-9160-498e-ae92-9bbdf071be7e-3
00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.960
can investigate your research and
classifications.

d203a1de-d45a-47ce-9e1b-004e5bbefe82-0
00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:24.242
But if you were to do the same in
relation to scatter radiation and

d203a1de-d45a-47ce-9e1b-004e5bbefe82-1
00:06:24.242 --> 00:06:27.760
protection, it's very,
very limited and a lot of the data is

d203a1de-d45a-47ce-9e1b-004e5bbefe82-2
00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:28.279
outdated.

f169a9f2-d9ce-4638-8352-c750f61514c9-0
00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:33.880
So that obviously doesn't build
confidence for the female operator.

f31092c6-f7a7-4b7c-b45b-5c8061bd2fc9-0
00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:39.679
In particular, because of our anatomy,
there is a lack of tailored outfits or

f31092c6-f7a7-4b7c-b45b-5c8061bd2fc9-1
00:06:39.679 --> 00:06:44.438
tailored support specific to the female
body and a female body,

f31092c6-f7a7-4b7c-b45b-5c8061bd2fc9-2
00:06:44.438 --> 00:06:47.933
not just as you are but also during
pregnancy,

f31092c6-f7a7-4b7c-b45b-5c8061bd2fc9-3
00:06:47.933 --> 00:06:51.800
and that could obviously be a problem or
a concern.

c92bcbd5-1823-47f7-b368-35d3c6b99b5f-0
00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:56.897
Luckily that is changing and you'll see
more and more companies supporting that

c92bcbd5-1823-47f7-b368-35d3c6b99b5f-1
00:06:56.897 --> 00:06:58.120
and giving solutions.

5cdecef2-8436-46c4-83f7-0665462b09db-0
00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.920
Balance protection and MSK problems.

faa59050-0adc-447e-9733-22267c40e8f1-0
00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:04.000
This is really, really important for all.

83d86d8b-e4c2-46e7-b6c3-7cc592f798c0-0
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.656
This has got nothing to do with how old
you are, male or female, lumbar support,

83d86d8b-e4c2-46e7-b6c3-7cc592f798c0-1
00:07:09.656 --> 00:07:12.240
back support, MSK, tendon and joints.

1e77c42c-9e11-4aaa-a4fc-edd1cfe646c0-0
00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.424
It's important that in this field and as
well as surgical,

1e77c42c-9e11-4aaa-a4fc-edd1cfe646c0-1
00:07:15.424 --> 00:07:19.851
and that's just this field, our balance,
our posture is important and we find the

1e77c42c-9e11-4aaa-a4fc-edd1cfe646c0-2
00:07:19.851 --> 00:07:23.360
correct supporting tools to not have back
pain or muscular pain.

a9432e1e-4813-4304-95c6-35918262dfac-0
00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.752
And again,
this comes with the lack of data,

a9432e1e-4813-4304-95c6-35918262dfac-1
00:07:26.752 --> 00:07:29.736
but hopefully during this mini virtual
conference,

a9432e1e-4813-4304-95c6-35918262dfac-2
00:07:29.736 --> 00:07:33.831
you will see many people speak about data
and work that they've done,

a9432e1e-4813-4304-95c6-35918262dfac-3
00:07:33.831 --> 00:07:37.400
which is promising and I'm really excited
to have that come.

805346b4-3544-46a0-ac80-cf057c25084b-0
00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:39.480
So what can we do?

758f3e5c-0f34-4dc3-ac5a-391d411f3aff-0
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.071
There is education and further education
and education to be shared,

758f3e5c-0f34-4dc3-ac5a-391d411f3aff-1
00:07:45.071 --> 00:07:48.600
like in this software shielding new
technology.

a38c106e-645e-4e2c-a50c-e41531ec7927-0
00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:52.240
And then there are practical tools that
are taught by physics.

51572321-39fc-44a2-b69d-6dedef000d41-0
00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.616
For example,
if I'm doing an EVAR procedure,

51572321-39fc-44a2-b69d-6dedef000d41-1
00:07:54.616 --> 00:07:57.520
it's just stepping back while I do the
angiogram runs.

2f6d4d60-161a-4b40-a64f-2ecdf40257da-0
00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:03.949
It's just a simple step that can be done
to minimize scatter covering around

2f6d4d60-161a-4b40-a64f-2ecdf40257da-1
00:08:03.949 --> 00:08:06.120
patient, around operators.

560d0320-0489-4d9a-8c18-de52398add0f-0
00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:09.254
And just again,
it's to do with understanding the scatter

560d0320-0489-4d9a-8c18-de52398add0f-1
00:08:09.254 --> 00:08:13.200
and how scatter works and the education
provided for understanding that.

9dc31774-75ff-491e-a3be-b5c7c8956de8-0
00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:17.280
And then later on being able to find the
tools that can help you with these things.

b7dbf042-f10c-4aad-a17d-50c65ef93067-0
00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.160
And this is important.

f2c9fdf4-25b2-4462-b54c-c87e0afd022e-0
00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:23.622
And it's down to us to work together to
ensure the future generations, you guys,

f2c9fdf4-25b2-4462-b54c-c87e0afd022e-1
00:08:23.622 --> 00:08:26.360
as you come in that you have the
knowledge and the tools.

bcb93caf-08d6-43ff-b727-1c6c9bce5720-0
00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:32.949
It's certainly a lot better than what it
was when I was doing my training a while

bcb93caf-08d6-43ff-b727-1c6c9bce5720-1
00:08:32.949 --> 00:08:33.320
back.

a8b0cd38-dd5e-4f40-b215-da72035f55c5-0
00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:35.240
When I was looking into this.

9427d19c-5ea2-4a70-9352-9ae4c96b5d40-0
00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:37.840
I tried to find support and material.

3353f898-b97d-416f-b269-a72f0c989d9c-0
00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.200
It was really limited.

f2b85501-b7a3-425a-a23e-e4e8a5adceed-0
00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.200
So we started by doing some surveys.

33c77a48-1f64-4b95-803b-fb9a2c990407-0
00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:42.920
2017.

10e44268-7e4c-46e1-a786-b81569824a2d-0
00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:46.726
We started with trainees and students,
which was interesting,

10e44268-7e4c-46e1-a786-b81569824a2d-1
00:08:46.726 --> 00:08:50.348
just their perception,
especially female trainee students,

10e44268-7e4c-46e1-a786-b81569824a2d-2
00:08:50.348 --> 00:08:53.480
just their perception of getting into
this career.

af99c441-029f-4f52-9e99-3a6f7f394080-0
00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:56.841
And then we followed it on in 2023 with
consultants,

af99c441-029f-4f52-9e99-3a6f7f394080-1
00:08:56.841 --> 00:09:02.169
but the focus was just in the UK to get a
little bit of understanding what is going

af99c441-029f-4f52-9e99-3a6f7f394080-2
00:09:02.169 --> 00:09:02.360
on.

74ff8365-e17e-4210-8e6d-de5ef3d2366a-0
00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:04.960
And it was interesting.

6b3f0f46-897e-4e09-87d1-bb85e68685aa-0
00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:11.448
So if if I just focus on the demographics
of the survey, as you can see, you know,

6b3f0f46-897e-4e09-87d1-bb85e68685aa-1
00:09:11.448 --> 00:09:14.400
a large proportion were senior
consultants.

a984a910-ac75-4409-9464-73664414481c-0
00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.560
This one was specifically for
interventional radiology in the UK.

f0c5454c-e5ec-47d1-922f-e86ff78047a2-0
00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:24.361
There there were some replies from nurses,
fellows and trainees and one of the main

f0c5454c-e5ec-47d1-922f-e86ff78047a2-1
00:09:24.361 --> 00:09:29.811
aspects that we wanted to understand is
what were they facing or what was their

f0c5454c-e5ec-47d1-922f-e86ff78047a2-2
00:09:29.811 --> 00:09:34.920
main concerns with regards to this field
in terms of radiation protection.

2e915efd-8ed3-4dbc-9172-ea9920634e04-0
00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:38.280
So you can see a good majority have been
in this field for a while.

be6db31e-513b-436c-9bd2-02eea59c0817-0
00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:45.105
And this is the interesting part is that
people still respond and notice the

be6db31e-513b-436c-9bd2-02eea59c0817-1
00:09:45.105 --> 00:09:50.520
visible and the obvious like back pain,
back posture, wrist pain, joint pain.

56010f68-c5ad-499b-ad70-72add4313d35-0
00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:54.828
But things that are not obvious that you
can't see until you actually have a

56010f68-c5ad-499b-ad70-72add4313d35-1
00:09:54.828 --> 00:09:57.140
problem,
you're not going to know about it and

56010f68-c5ad-499b-ad70-72add4313d35-2
00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:59.600
you're not going to be probably worried
about it.

edda7d20-5d1f-4895-af39-f213600f769c-0
00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:04.880
For example, brain tumors, 0% that I mean,
thank God for that, but we don't know.

8cb11da0-00dd-42ee-8ba5-290af5dc47fd-0
00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:06.938
I mean,
I don't know later on what's going to

8cb11da0-00dd-42ee-8ba5-290af5dc47fd-1
00:10:06.938 --> 00:10:07.520
happen to me.

4f3f2d1d-35e8-4cfe-b2d5-c5681478314b-0
00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.440
There's no way of knowing at this stage.

04565f4f-0b6c-4e6a-99e4-48adca0686ba-0
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.333
Breast cancer unfortunately is on the
rise and there is an article that we will

04565f4f-0b6c-4e6a-99e4-48adca0686ba-1
00:10:16.333 --> 00:10:21.666
try and share during this virtual meeting
with you that seems to be also on the

04565f4f-0b6c-4e6a-99e4-48adca0686ba-2
00:10:21.666 --> 00:10:21.999
rise.

8cc8b49a-e4b2-4882-88b4-67441407d0fd-0
00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:26.627
What's important and what I would like to
stress is that this information,

8cc8b49a-e4b2-4882-88b4-67441407d0fd-1
00:10:26.627 --> 00:10:30.639
what we're trying to share with you,
it's got nothing to do with scaring you

8cc8b49a-e4b2-4882-88b4-67441407d0fd-2
00:10:30.639 --> 00:10:34.495
or to say that you should not go into
this field or that, Oh my goodness,

8cc8b49a-e4b2-4882-88b4-67441407d0fd-3
00:10:34.495 --> 00:10:36.840
this field is really bad and deadly for
you.

9f7ec3dc-cd3c-486d-8b2c-0ccba8472b1d-0
00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:38.040
In fact, it's the opposite.

b6327478-cd0a-4bce-b502-116707c64e46-0
00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:41.092
It's to say that you can have an
absolutely amazing career,

b6327478-cd0a-4bce-b502-116707c64e46-1
00:10:41.092 --> 00:10:44.400
you can absolutely have a great time and
be a healthy clinician.

315796a2-32ee-4b00-80eb-7658935c56fd-0
00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:47.507
However,
what we'd like you to do is to be aware

315796a2-32ee-4b00-80eb-7658935c56fd-1
00:10:47.507 --> 00:10:52.240
of the problems that can happen if you
don't take care, which is life in general.

6d688e90-5979-474c-863f-fba5e3471d36-0
00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:56.000
So I just want everybody from this to
make sure that every time I'm talking

6d688e90-5979-474c-863f-fba5e3471d36-1
00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.480
about something, not to be scared,
not to be frightened, not to be put off.

81e03844-16b3-4285-8bc5-2dd25632fbe6-0
00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:00.960
It's none of those.

7c82cfc3-f64c-4425-9ff8-abb4de02385a-0
00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:04.974
It's just to say you need the right tools
and the right protection all the time

7c82cfc3-f64c-4425-9ff8-abb4de02385a-1
00:11:04.974 --> 00:11:09.040
when you're working with scatter to avoid
all these problems that we are seeing.

65ff929a-df6b-4ab5-9503-fa6fc45b80f9-0
00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:15.440
So in terms of radiation protection,
we just wanted to get labour.

42f2bed0-09f9-41c9-9543-864e3afaecf4-0
00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.040
What's going on out there?

7ee84594-ac4c-41b4-a3d9-3d167aeda5ea-0
00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:20.190
And if people felt they were adequately
protected,

7ee84594-ac4c-41b4-a3d9-3d167aeda5ea-1
00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:24.762
and this is the interesting bit,
these are senior colleagues and 40% felt

7ee84594-ac4c-41b4-a3d9-3d167aeda5ea-2
00:11:24.762 --> 00:11:29.520
they weren't adequately protected and 70%
didn't have the adequate training.

60e5f515-7b51-4490-a078-c924b0fd2a06-0
00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:33.697
So just because a lot of people in their
training would have physics exams and all

60e5f515-7b51-4490-a078-c924b0fd2a06-1
00:11:33.697 --> 00:11:36.716
sorts of cumbersome exams,
it didn't mean that it was actually

60e5f515-7b51-4490-a078-c924b0fd2a06-2
00:11:36.716 --> 00:11:39.400
practical to what's being operated and
done day-to-day.

ab6f4953-775c-4e7b-b7d3-34d00d87129d-0
00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:41.120
And this is crucial.

17e2719c-ff91-4a34-81e7-66e2fcf833c7-0
00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:45.948
And when we looked at females and
pregnant staff,

17e2719c-ff91-4a34-81e7-66e2fcf833c7-1
00:11:45.948 --> 00:11:49.720
was there any reasonable adjustments
during pregnancy?

8f9a04af-43a6-4296-a0c9-5e5f89bb2ba6-0
00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:50.600
And this is worrying.

6190585b-6889-4c02-a876-0337e5d485d3-0
00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:55.023
I kind of anticipated that there would be,
especially as things have changed with

6190585b-6889-4c02-a876-0337e5d485d3-1
00:11:55.023 --> 00:11:58.800
time and we have all sorts of radiation
protection offices, etcetera.

ce293742-4cba-4f46-900e-b510ed472681-0
00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:02.489
This was still very poor,
which again goes hand in hand with the

ce293742-4cba-4f46-900e-b510ed472681-1
00:12:02.489 --> 00:12:04.760
lack of education and lack of awareness.

5f1a443a-185a-4f64-a0fa-5131ee51fa98-0
00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:07.440
Being pregnant should not stop you from
history.

e12e4725-d1a5-4fb2-86d5-8ae86ccb41ca-0
00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:12.053
You can absolutely go as far as you want
during your pregnancy with your work with

e12e4725-d1a5-4fb2-86d5-8ae86ccb41ca-1
00:12:12.053 --> 00:12:12.720
no problems.

f85dcc63-ed08-4a5d-a84e-1f5bf787118a-0
00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:15.720
Adjustments yes, tools and solutions, yes.

55e1af8a-93f0-42b0-9e08-2058c6fd7927-0
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.200
But for you to be forced to stop?

4bab64cf-d565-493f-a5d2-f8694c897aa5-0
00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:19.200
Absolutely not.

468b3c75-fffa-44ba-88af-7961ad8e1811-0
00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:22.499
You can actually have a safe,
smooth journey so long as you are

468b3c75-fffa-44ba-88af-7961ad8e1811-1
00:12:22.499 --> 00:12:24.040
comfortable and you're able to.

378e719e-81b7-4b2d-86e2-c2bf9d2b3a0b-0
00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:31.400
So this is a further breakdown to see
what the pregnant snap.

1289778c-d504-4f14-92a8-1fc1bde3c7d2-0
00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:35.290
Obviously that responded to this also,
we didn't get such a high proportion of

1289778c-d504-4f14-92a8-1fc1bde3c7d2-1
00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:37.802
response,
but those that did showed that there was

1289778c-d504-4f14-92a8-1fc1bde3c7d2-2
00:12:37.802 --> 00:12:39.280
no individual risk assessment.

c7e44cc6-81f5-45a8-a8b5-77cba7664461-0
00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:40.320
This is really important.

cd95a9fe-d563-4455-ad83-9e1c7faa1699-0
00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:42.400
The assessment has to be specific for you.

d7df6bab-b33d-49d9-8e67-1356c5c58d55-0
00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:46.347
You know, you could be a petite lady,
you could have a single pregnancy versus

d7df6bab-b33d-49d9-8e67-1356c5c58d55-1
00:12:46.347 --> 00:12:49.040
somebody else who's much taller with a
triplet pregnancy.

e2071f34-931e-4f79-892a-a94be8453d4f-0
00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:51.200
It really has to be specific for you.

1bbe90af-6a09-47d8-8e01-dd8d0f4af1b8-0
00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:54.920
And real time monitoring is also an
interesting one.

9e040c8b-dc1c-4c87-a5e0-7c8597be37c7-0
00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:58.560
I think this is very important during the
pregnancy stages.

fc347470-2bb1-482c-9a3e-9c51004e6e59-0
00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:02.160
But almost 82% had nothing.

c11cb6b0-b4c6-4124-be3f-7a00e35434f9-0
00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:07.540
So you could see that there are a lot of
gap holes here that were picked up by the

c11cb6b0-b4c6-4124-be3f-7a00e35434f9-1
00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:10.962
survey from things like lack of education,
lack of awareness,

c11cb6b0-b4c6-4124-be3f-7a00e35434f9-2
00:13:10.962 --> 00:13:14.328
even basic things that have you got a
designated lead apron,

c11cb6b0-b4c6-4124-be3f-7a00e35434f9-3
00:13:14.328 --> 00:13:18.246
you're a senior consultant in that
particular department working there

c11cb6b0-b4c6-4124-be3f-7a00e35434f9-4
00:13:18.246 --> 00:13:22.551
almost every day that you don't have a
specific LED that is specific speak to

c11cb6b0-b4c6-4124-be3f-7a00e35434f9-5
00:13:22.551 --> 00:13:23.600
you and your needs.

3fa5e0d6-e4df-4582-83c6-b3139e19a49d-0
00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:26.320
I don't believe that should be case.

2ace29b3-345a-49b4-93b9-b494240ad372-0
00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:29.640
And these are just images that I wanted
to share with you.

3ae2a5df-8ece-47e3-9834-e0813b08b295-0
00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:31.600
Why we in specific.

0c349c95-5630-4df8-9681-ec7b79a2ac7c-0
00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:37.413
So this female has got, you know,
random lead that she's got on,

0c349c95-5630-4df8-9681-ec7b79a2ac7c-1
00:13:37.413 --> 00:13:39.560
but it's gaping through.

036d11f5-8c4b-4f3f-af0d-6090e493b4eb-0
00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:40.800
It's not specific to her body.

947c056e-e424-47ec-acb8-523e397a41e4-0
00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:45.780
So she's already got her axilla and parts
of her breast tissue exposed to scatter,

947c056e-e424-47ec-acb8-523e397a41e4-1
00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:48.120
especially if she's a primary operator.

41411d95-b2ef-48de-9b8d-320dab3d4c2b-0
00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:52.621
But luckily we do have tools over time,
we've found lead that can wrap around

41411d95-b2ef-48de-9b8d-320dab3d4c2b-1
00:13:52.621 --> 00:13:53.000
better.

ec1fab3e-e0dd-40f8-a824-d6d3a4d4094f-0
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.080
They can come and cross and cover that
area.

2253ad06-1acd-46db-abce-f25a69dcc396-0
00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:58.520
We found something that has that support
so it's not heavy.

7f9d7b34-3f7b-4492-9904-455d84778621-0
00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:01.056
So again, the point is, yes,
there are problems,

7f9d7b34-3f7b-4492-9904-455d84778621-1
00:14:01.056 --> 00:14:04.630
but there are also solutions that you
need to be aware of them and you need to

7f9d7b34-3f7b-4492-9904-455d84778621-2
00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:06.440
find the one that's comfortable for you.

9bf68477-ed78-4f36-9c4b-d62c5f946eb6-0
00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:08.440
But it's not just about lead.

c8915e21-db66-4a45-82eb-2de2ed24735e-0
00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:11.400
There are now tools where you don't even
have to wear lead.

d421c51b-e5ef-4ac2-b148-41e0190d3227-0
00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:15.440
There are shieldings that go around the
operating field, around your unit of what?

a0a17fc2-2523-4149-b9a9-531f686f0af7-0
00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:19.080
So either you do not have to wear lead or
you can wear very light lead.

0b58c226-548d-4d90-b7b9-66f7e1d66566-0
00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:20.200
This is amazing.

81f203ec-bc7d-4626-a647-9751035d52b7-0
00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:23.830
This is significant,
especially if your field has repeated

81f203ec-bc7d-4626-a647-9751035d52b7-1
00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:25.000
similar procedures.

60b9100c-1249-4fd9-a416-69f7db2357a7-0
00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:28.200
These allow for this type of protection.

737a980a-f4f3-415d-aa95-7ed1bbc7eff7-0
00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:34.040
So the facts are yes radiation exists and
scatter exist, but just not an issue.

29eb88e9-4ea5-49cc-865a-b69813a318ca-0
00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:37.703
There are run through posts and
specialities and depending on your

29eb88e9-4ea5-49cc-865a-b69813a318ca-1
00:14:37.703 --> 00:14:41.113
country, most countries do have that,
so you don't have to spend time

29eb88e9-4ea5-49cc-865a-b69813a318ca-2
00:14:41.113 --> 00:14:44.280
flickering between specialities to get to
the one that you want.

14594655-3274-40fe-bc60-4853107b5236-0
00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:47.658
Yes, there are fewer females,
but I don't think that's going to be the

14594655-3274-40fe-bc60-4853107b5236-1
00:14:47.658 --> 00:14:48.160
case forever.

ff0dc236-ea6a-4310-8925-1b287a95b4df-0
00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:52.613
I think you will see a lot more females
emerging through, but in all honesty,

ff0dc236-ea6a-4310-8925-1b287a95b4df-1
00:14:52.613 --> 00:14:56.040
I don't think you need to have a male or
female role model.

c1091e3e-f910-4023-8bc2-da1cf95fecd8-0
00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:56.720
It doesn't matter.

62379828-5bcf-4a6f-a84b-894d4b8a469c-0
00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:58.694
You just need to find somebody who's
supportive,

62379828-5bcf-4a6f-a84b-894d4b8a469c-1
00:14:58.694 --> 00:15:01.797
who's going to take you through this
journey and guide you and pass on their

62379828-5bcf-4a6f-a84b-894d4b8a469c-2
00:15:01.797 --> 00:15:02.080
wisdom.

8f075994-ef93-4800-9f9d-fa9d4e204de9-0
00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:03.360
That's the most important thing.

172be6aa-213a-4d77-aadb-f9dd972e6054-0
00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:07.231
Of course it does help if they understand
some of the things you're going through,

172be6aa-213a-4d77-aadb-f9dd972e6054-1
00:15:07.231 --> 00:15:09.200
but I wouldn't say it's the limiting
factor.

5bd5384c-f06a-4959-bb30-7e8af5a6226a-0
00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:11.160
Work, work life balance.

c3e3db9d-9af9-4454-8a24-c0e47e884394-0
00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:13.280
Now this has become more and more
important.

b35befaa-deda-4e6c-9123-94ee169d999c-0
00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:17.840
I definitely know in the olden days this
is not a topic that was discussed nor a

b35befaa-deda-4e6c-9123-94ee169d999c-1
00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:19.360
topic that was cared about.

30539518-fa5f-4879-a62f-dc025613d734-0
00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:23.650
But now as we have more evidence,
not just for medicine but in general of

30539518-fa5f-4879-a62f-dc025613d734-1
00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:27.593
the importance of work life balance,
there's a lot more being done,

30539518-fa5f-4879-a62f-dc025613d734-2
00:15:27.593 --> 00:15:30.840
such as part time roles, flexi roles,
job shared roles.

46ee08d8-ae8a-4489-b069-aa263feaecc6-0
00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:33.578
And again,
it just depends on where you intend to

46ee08d8-ae8a-4489-b069-aa263feaecc6-1
00:15:33.578 --> 00:15:33.800
work.

8b484d25-22f6-4d13-a006-160a9638cf19-0
00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:35.440
Open that conversation and have it.

e1566715-c85c-4170-9efa-0aee5b3e3672-0
00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:38.320
There's absolutely nothing to say you
can't go part time.

1c2d5aad-fc3f-42b3-914a-14ad0fe68514-0
00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:41.520
There's absolutely nothing to say you
cannot share certain roles.

5a22b255-6fb8-4935-9be7-c0cc1132b1fa-0
00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:43.680
There's nothing to say there for a
particular.

b26bfa21-f0a1-4227-92b1-a5e0acf09da9-0
00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:44.240
In your life.

98ee49cc-b0fb-4914-a628-2b3ce9a6cb9c-0
00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:47.360
You may need flexi working and then you
can go back to full time.

85014e13-50d6-4076-8739-9980250e05d8-0
00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:50.720
All of these things now are in place and
you're able to have that.

0fc70c34-1182-4a47-9acb-bd12f27d4818-0
00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:54.646
So I'm just sharing with you to show,
you know,

0fc70c34-1182-4a47-9acb-bd12f27d4818-1
00:15:54.646 --> 00:15:57.534
normal job logs like me is able to reach
all of this,

0fc70c34-1182-4a47-9acb-bd12f27d4818-2
00:15:57.534 --> 00:16:01.224
to take part in all various conferences,
national and international,

0fc70c34-1182-4a47-9acb-bd12f27d4818-3
00:16:01.224 --> 00:16:02.080
be given awards.

68e9febc-1e47-466c-bab3-6f2c948e784b-0
00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:03.200
And I'm nothing amazing.

837bc8e8-3df0-40f2-b0fb-8f777909621d-0
00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:08.000
I'm not somebody who is super smart or in
any form, just really average Joe.

af5ca438-55cd-4fde-9794-2bc138629df4-0
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.240
I was able to do it all.

53df9747-4f98-493a-b2e7-5bb29b78df32-0
00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:12.200
And life is not just about what's in the
hospital.

36053b35-d6ca-4694-b4d4-067e2ef78305-0
00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:13.920
It's also about what's outside the
hospital.

6332a42d-d312-4c89-b5cf-d979fabb40d5-0
00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:18.040
You can have you can run marathons,
you can't go to extreme places.

1367ca45-6c42-4a81-be9f-e37efa4db64b-0
00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:19.480
You can do it all.

dce459bd-1cb2-495e-a503-640f93467ad5-0
00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:21.582
Now,
it's not necessary that you'll do it all

dce459bd-1cb2-495e-a503-640f93467ad5-1
00:16:21.582 --> 00:16:24.325
at the same time,
but you will do it through various stages

dce459bd-1cb2-495e-a503-640f93467ad5-2
00:16:24.325 --> 00:16:24.919
of your life.

d39c2229-292e-4557-ac4a-ab08ff9d96ea-0
00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:29.015
And of course,
your work family are probably one of the

d39c2229-292e-4557-ac4a-ab08ff9d96ea-1
00:16:29.015 --> 00:16:33.840
most important things in this path that
will support you and help you during that.

f52abdef-f4fa-48b3-8701-368411d45e9b-0
00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:37.134
And I think it's, you know,
it goes without say working with an

f52abdef-f4fa-48b3-8701-368411d45e9b-1
00:16:37.134 --> 00:16:39.400
amazing team,
it is the icing and the cake.

e0395acd-c36d-45b5-be78-966312db444c-0
00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:43.126
So I would definitely recommend everybody
find the way you're happy,

e0395acd-c36d-45b5-be78-966312db444c-1
00:16:43.126 --> 00:16:47.068
find the team that supports you,
take that job because it's it really is

e0395acd-c36d-45b5-be78-966312db444c-2
00:16:47.068 --> 00:16:48.040
the making of you.

019ae0c3-c251-450e-abb7-9a5cefce1e71-0
00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:53.480
And so again, in summary,
this is not to scare you.

f89b3080-7e7c-41b7-93c3-db983cab369d-0
00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:56.500
This is just to say in everything,
in every shield,

f89b3080-7e7c-41b7-93c3-db983cab369d-1
00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:59.440
there will be problems and these are what
they are.

e2186139-8762-4bb2-a2c6-28d11012be9c-0
00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:02.760
And we have solutions and that's what we
interventions do.

95ef6382-bc7f-4a3f-a5fa-8034d9ae0a43-0
00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:04.160
That's exactly what we do.

548b60aa-adaa-4654-9616-5e8e1cfe434d-0
00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:07.680
We find health problems and we find and
we create solutions for them.

c3558a55-51f9-45e7-b12e-4e6df3619c94-0
00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:10.160
It's never about, Oh my God,
this is what it's best.

ef1c95e6-0dff-434a-97dd-0d6d2b9c6a7f-0
00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:11.960
Now we all need to give up this three.

c9a5fe76-abfc-4c04-98cd-28d39bbe95cc-0
00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:13.120
Absolutely not.

baf76726-6dcc-4408-b10a-8236ff6605a8-0
00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:16.456
So please guys,
feel free to reach out to me at any point,

baf76726-6dcc-4408-b10a-8236ff6605a8-1
00:17:16.456 --> 00:17:17.920
even outside of this meeting.

141d7eed-69ad-4eb4-8825-d38a15066cc3-0
00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:22.591
If you come across any problems that you
want to highlight or you want to find

141d7eed-69ad-4eb4-8825-d38a15066cc3-1
00:17:22.591 --> 00:17:24.360
solutions for, please do reach out.

55bdc579-09d5-45df-9e21-8dc1af44e9b3-0
00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:26.987
Whether it's through here or any other
platform,

55bdc579-09d5-45df-9e21-8dc1af44e9b3-1
00:17:26.987 --> 00:17:29.240
I'm more than happy to take your question.

4f0da528-e800-45d5-8c2c-5f9d23a5d2d3-0
00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:30.560
Thank you for your time.

bd7d7342-b262-4b87-b6b5-10e8f75f21d9-0
00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:33.080
Hi everyone.

9f85ac7b-418e-4446-b988-d656e4d8a711-0
00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:37.429
I am Doctor Linda Watkins and I'm a
consultant adult and pediatric

9f85ac7b-418e-4446-b988-d656e4d8a711-1
00:17:37.429 --> 00:17:41.000
interventional radiologist based in
Glasgow, Scotland.

dc22b56e-96d8-40ac-a988-fdfd35a0e393-0
00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:44.960
And I'm here to talk today about
pregnancy and radiation.

37224e99-b974-4aad-b95a-a4eaa114a2c4-0
00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:48.902
So I don't have any financial disclosures
or anything like that,

37224e99-b974-4aad-b95a-a4eaa114a2c4-1
00:17:48.902 --> 00:17:53.512
but I think it is quite important to
disclose that I have not been pregnant

37224e99-b974-4aad-b95a-a4eaa114a2c4-2
00:17:53.512 --> 00:17:56.000
while working in a radiation environment.

3ad8bd62-0eb9-4898-a5d0-f3f219407a95-0
00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:00.153
However, I am,
along with a colleague responsible for

3ad8bd62-0eb9-4898-a5d0-f3f219407a95-1
00:18:00.153 --> 00:18:03.160
the education and training within my
department.

18e34e2f-bf37-40da-8a47-98c5f6c9e094-0
00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:07.428
So I have a supervisory role and
responsibility to those resident doctors

18e34e2f-bf37-40da-8a47-98c5f6c9e094-1
00:18:07.428 --> 00:18:09.800
to know what I'm talking about
effectively.

fda717c0-d773-47c5-b5f4-df2d2e6295a5-0
00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:16.040
So we're going to completely focus on the
group of people that the session title is.

ac971069-9813-4dbb-a1b4-4a54b0b47664-0
00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:21.160
So that is those in practice,
those working in radiation environments.

adbd08e9-ab59-4bb6-a180-f1e69c98cddf-0
00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:26.744
Now there is of course another huge group
who get exposed to radiation in pregnancy

adbd08e9-ab59-4bb6-a180-f1e69c98cddf-1
00:18:26.744 --> 00:18:27.920
and that is patients.

ff56fa37-2b60-453d-8d6b-759cea187d91-0
00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:31.456
But there's really very different
considerations there,

ff56fa37-2b60-453d-8d6b-759cea187d91-1
00:18:31.456 --> 00:18:33.640
and they're not time to talk about both.

8a6784f8-2a4c-4e5e-8d96-a8794c9ac76a-0
00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:38.526
In the UK, where I'm based,
we have separate legislation covering a

8a6784f8-2a4c-4e5e-8d96-a8794c9ac76a-1
00:18:38.526 --> 00:18:41.240
medical exposure versus occupational
exposure.

af87e7ce-7314-4885-8262-a66ec9a1443b-0
00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:45.800
And I'll come back and talk about the
occupational exposure legislation shortly.

3ee4435e-437e-40b7-9f93-f413a2a43453-0
00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:49.874
But it's important to realize that these
are separate issues with completely

3ee4435e-437e-40b7-9f93-f413a2a43453-1
00:18:49.874 --> 00:18:51.080
different considerations.

486e4337-84aa-4df0-b7f5-f2e5f3dd242d-0
00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:54.031
So First off,
what are the risks of radiation exposure

486e4337-84aa-4df0-b7f5-f2e5f3dd242d-1
00:18:54.031 --> 00:18:54.720
in pregnancy?

531ffcfd-0ed1-4a8d-bfe7-175551f54a5b-0
00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:57.931
Well,
that depends very much on where in the

531ffcfd-0ed1-4a8d-bfe7-175551f54a5b-1
00:18:57.931 --> 00:18:58.960
pregnancy you are.

afd2836f-8cb9-4d7f-9d23-6a8e4ee76717-0
00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:02.563
This is a really great graphical
representation I think that was put

afd2836f-8cb9-4d7f-9d23-6a8e4ee76717-1
00:19:02.563 --> 00:19:03.880
together by Applegate ET al.

5394f705-a04a-4069-8b0e-e6fbd0c8bff3-0
00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:08.002
And it's really important to note that
the majority of this graph,

5394f705-a04a-4069-8b0e-e6fbd0c8bff3-1
00:19:08.002 --> 00:19:12.156
if you look across the top scale here,
is referring to only up to 50 days post

5394f705-a04a-4069-8b0e-e6fbd0c8bff3-2
00:19:12.156 --> 00:19:14.679
conception,
so well within the first trimester.

db3478f9-3548-42a9-8adc-384b3354c521-0
00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:19.389
We can therefore see that the risk is
greatest in the earliest stages of

db3478f9-3548-42a9-8adc-384b3354c521-1
00:19:19.389 --> 00:19:22.094
pregnancy,
less in the second trimester and even

db3478f9-3548-42a9-8adc-384b3354c521-2
00:19:22.094 --> 00:19:23.640
less in the third trimester.

135b5955-032b-4fff-bf76-3ad3850befae-0
00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:28.342
The coloured lanes on this graph
delineate the deterministic effects of

135b5955-032b-4fff-bf76-3ad3850befae-1
00:19:28.342 --> 00:19:29.640
radiation in pregnancy.

1fbaf91c-d900-48c9-901c-70939ad750a7-0
00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:34.362
So that's the dose dependent risks,
that's things like neuropathology,

1fbaf91c-d900-48c9-901c-70939ad750a7-1
00:19:34.362 --> 00:19:37.555
growth restriction, malformations,
miscarriage,

1fbaf91c-d900-48c9-901c-70939ad750a7-2
00:19:37.555 --> 00:19:41.280
and all of these peak in the early stages
of pregnancy.

2f7723c6-4a0c-45c9-8ea3-3025c6a0868b-0
00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:45.623
But this figure also shows this block
down at the bottom,

2f7723c6-4a0c-45c9-8ea3-3025c6a0868b-1
00:19:45.623 --> 00:19:50.960
at the bottom right and that is the
stochastic effects of carcinogenesis.

d6b0452d-0659-4456-af67-cdfcd26fef2d-0
00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:56.266
And this risk remains static,
went after the organogenesis phase and

d6b0452d-0659-4456-af67-cdfcd26fef2d-1
00:19:56.266 --> 00:20:01.600
you would expect that for something that
doesn't require a dose threshold.

f6614aff-ccd9-4bf9-8013-640c1bfafb6f-0
00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:07.480
But what doses are we talking about for
the risk to pregnancy?

6c3b75a9-5f0e-4ba8-8b2f-f7e0a24d8164-0
00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:10.921
And to be honest,
the short answer to this is we don't

6c3b75a9-5f0e-4ba8-8b2f-f7e0a24d8164-1
00:20:10.921 --> 00:20:11.480
really know.

a3566ef9-857a-4c50-be24-627b0955956c-0
00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:16.975
The main studies that have been done are
with the huge doses of fallout radiation

a3566ef9-857a-4c50-be24-627b0955956c-1
00:20:16.975 --> 00:20:21.360
of events like Hiroshima and Chernobyl,
and some very clever physics.

44340bf3-3415-4f44-8d28-87c6dc701c14-0
00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:25.458
People have done some extrapolation
calculations and come up with this table

44340bf3-3415-4f44-8d28-87c6dc701c14-1
00:20:25.458 --> 00:20:27.960
that's in the Joint Sir and Cersei
guidelines.

d169fc2d-8c1b-4d8f-b57b-a0e08c8e0970-0
00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:32.678
And this shows nicely the the probability
of no malformations,

d169fc2d-8c1b-4d8f-b57b-a0e08c8e0970-1
00:20:32.678 --> 00:20:37.080
no childhood cancer and the probability
of neither thing happening.

9c70b6eb-7326-4d5a-9711-1d5c7f21b647-0
00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:41.120
And these are then placed against the the
dose here.

d5761168-ec7b-4cae-aba4-735e8dbc9a95-0
00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:45.446
And this shows that there's only very
slight increases in the probability of

d5761168-ec7b-4cae-aba4-735e8dbc9a95-1
00:20:45.446 --> 00:20:48.280
either thing happening up to really quite
large doses.

50c9dc15-39f6-46b3-b49a-a26b487b7d14-0
00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:52.656
There's less than a percentage increase
in all three columns up to 100

50c9dc15-39f6-46b3-b49a-a26b487b7d14-1
00:20:52.656 --> 00:20:53.520
millisieverts.

a6f9675f-9c8e-4b22-a73e-c549d20ed577-0
00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:58.520
Some important context here as well is,
but nobody gets zero.

327c7036-1c43-4a80-9bb4-02c770a535dc-0
00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:01.260
OK,
there's still background radiation to

327c7036-1c43-4a80-9bb4-02c770a535dc-1
00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:02.240
consider as well.

72c2055d-9e79-44fd-94aa-566c11e1b481-0
00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:05.120
And we all get that just from existing.

7f31a17b-eed3-40a6-9155-f65360f846c8-0
00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:07.720
And in the UK that can actually be really
quite variable.

b66cba0a-8f3a-4a61-bb5c-0888f023295a-0
00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:10.320
It can be up to 8 millisieverts in places.

9dbb5025-15ae-4bac-b633-49a718ef2adf-0
00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:16.340
And that's mainly to do with radon either
in the earth or from a granite that's

9dbb5025-15ae-4bac-b633-49a718ef2adf-1
00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:19.200
used in some places for for buildings.

b36f02c3-b40a-464e-893b-8fb76e119810-0
00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:25.980
So the question then becomes what am I
adding to my background radiation with my

b36f02c3-b40a-464e-893b-8fb76e119810-1
00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:27.160
occupational exposure?

f4f72ee4-cfb7-401b-8d87-f2f6493510af-0
00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:29.040
Now, you should know this.

d6074875-3b22-4bf0-83d1-efc1191382c0-0
00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:32.840
And if you don't ask,
this is where wedding you're assigned.

7fdc20f5-2be5-4032-9ec8-9714b6a30c70-0
00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:37.630
Decimeters is really important both for
protecting you but also medical physics

7fdc20f5-2be5-4032-9ec8-9714b6a30c70-1
00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:41.462
can look at your doses,
look at what your usual exposure is and

7fdc20f5-2be5-4032-9ec8-9714b6a30c70-2
00:21:41.462 --> 00:21:45.893
make a prediction of the exposure that
you will have over the course of a

7fdc20f5-2be5-4032-9ec8-9714b6a30c70-3
00:21:45.893 --> 00:21:50.684
pregnancy and then be able to make an
estimate from that of what the fetal dose

7fdc20f5-2be5-4032-9ec8-9714b6a30c70-4
00:21:50.684 --> 00:21:52.719
would be throughout the pregnancy.

8ab6955c-5eed-410a-975f-78d11ff99062-0
00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:58.471
Most interventional radiologists have
have doses of around 2:00 to 4:00 milli

8ab6955c-5eed-410a-975f-78d11ff99062-1
00:21:58.471 --> 00:22:01.768
sieverts a year,
so even with their background radiation

8ab6955c-5eed-410a-975f-78d11ff99062-2
00:22:01.768 --> 00:22:05.817
many are still be below the pure
background dose that some people are

8ab6955c-5eed-410a-975f-78d11ff99062-3
00:22:05.817 --> 00:22:06.280
getting.

04edbc43-045a-4f07-a06c-9f7c52daa907-0
00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:11.246
The European recommendation is to keep
equivalent doses to the fetus at less

04edbc43-045a-4f07-a06c-9f7c52daa907-1
00:22:11.246 --> 00:22:14.000
than one milli sieverte over the course
of pregnancy.

4e4e1812-e55f-4f05-9630-20f06f38c58b-0
00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:17.280
But other countries have other
recommendation.

65d8db88-4434-4e4b-9e57-3ebbd503a250-0
00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:19.200
And that again,
just reflects the we don't.

babb2988-ea31-43df-8c2f-08cd55f3924f-0
00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:21.720
We're not sure that I referred to earlier.

83efb6aa-b318-488f-b6f4-0efd04fd5989-0
00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:24.480
There isn't much in the published
literature.

c1d88743-3bee-4ad5-b884-cfd61300a9ba-0
00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:29.360
And what there is is about 10 years old
really, but particularly for radiologists.

072f75b4-cde5-42b9-a845-ce602937ef50-0
00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:34.272
Radiologists do seem to stay within these
these those limits and are not routinely

072f75b4-cde5-42b9-a845-ce602937ef50-1
00:22:34.272 --> 00:22:36.120
exceeding the recommended doses.

778f0d88-29f6-4e88-9834-9ed69b8c6c02-0
00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:38.800
So how can you reduce the risks?

a84e047c-eb11-4103-af03-22d22e6408c4-0
00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:40.800
Honestly, that's really simple.

a37efa98-923c-4f73-9e88-132ee0bbeabe-0
00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:44.680
Do all of the things that you should be
doing anyway.

549fa99c-3c7c-4560-a81b-adfea26175ac-0
00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:50.167
There's something that's kind of funny
about the human condition that although

549fa99c-3c7c-4560-a81b-adfea26175ac-1
00:22:50.167 --> 00:22:53.832
we can be really quite selfish sometimes,
we're actually better at looking after or

549fa99c-3c7c-4560-a81b-adfea26175ac-2
00:22:53.832 --> 00:22:56.319
thinking about other people than we are
about ourselves.

7c51f57f-6b6a-41b3-8c5e-71b5bf23b3ff-0
00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:00.445
So I will make sure that a resident
doctor has their LED glasses on and

7c51f57f-6b6a-41b3-8c5e-71b5bf23b3ff-1
00:23:00.445 --> 00:23:04.040
brings in the the screen more than I'll
do it for myself sometimes.

17e5d20f-a11d-4cde-8b3f-c8dc3079393c-0
00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:06.160
And I'm sure some of you can relate to
that.

b9244fa8-12d5-4441-9f5c-2b3e08c06f50-0
00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:08.680
So what sort of things am I referring to?

a5127900-40c5-47f1-ba78-8cb6cb794e54-0
00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:13.430
So things like wedding your personal
protective equipment, all of it,

a5127900-40c5-47f1-ba78-8cb6cb794e54-1
00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:17.366
your decimeters, your lead glasses,
your thyroid Shields,

a5127900-40c5-47f1-ba78-8cb6cb794e54-2
00:23:17.366 --> 00:23:22.320
wedding appropriate aprons that should be
at least .5mm lead equivalent.

5dde89a7-c448-4e96-bafa-9c12c7017db9-0
00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:25.240
Use the room shielding in IR.

e4d924d6-2043-4d8a-9aeb-a0831ea23182-0
00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:29.109
There should be leg protection from a
shield that often attaches to the patient

e4d924d6-2043-4d8a-9aeb-a0831ea23182-1
00:23:29.109 --> 00:23:29.400
table.

3b867b8e-7514-41cc-9f13-d7b0843c1e94-0
00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:33.200
Make sure it's on the side of the table
that you're that you're working on.

023f41a3-c519-4659-8f5e-7dd7867ef927-0
00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:37.250
And there's often ceiling maintage
Shields or mobile Shields that can be

023f41a3-c519-4659-8f5e-7dd7867ef927-1
00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:39.640
wheeled into place to give extra
protection as well.

223233f2-cd69-47a2-b89b-e794fbe2b328-0
00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.555
During procedures,
we should always be taking steps to

223233f2-cd69-47a2-b89b-e794fbe2b328-1
00:23:43.555 --> 00:23:45.600
minimize the radiation dose to the
patient.

f19cfc4c-92ad-4d4b-8edc-c0e2270714b9-0
00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:48.505
And by taking those steps,
we also minimize the dose to ourselves

f19cfc4c-92ad-4d4b-8edc-c0e2270714b9-1
00:23:48.505 --> 00:23:50.838
because the majority of the dose comes
from scatter,

f19cfc4c-92ad-4d4b-8edc-c0e2270714b9-2
00:23:50.838 --> 00:23:53.920
which is going to be related to the dose
that the patient is getting.

a91395c1-e716-4985-a745-5920b586e478-0
00:23:54.480 --> 00:24:00.437
So we need to minimize the fluoro time,
reduce the fluoroscopy rate if you can as

a91395c1-e716-4985-a745-5920b586e478-1
00:24:00.437 --> 00:24:05.959
well minimize the air gap between the
patient and the detector column it to

a91395c1-e716-4985-a745-5920b586e478-2
00:24:05.959 --> 00:24:08.720
reduce the area that is being exposed.

e65a6bd3-f9fb-4bd4-9ec5-b19e1f8c72ff-0
00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:12.521
Avoid magnification when it's not
necessary for the task at hand,

e65a6bd3-f9fb-4bd4-9ec5-b19e1f8c72ff-1
00:24:12.521 --> 00:24:16.200
and remember to turn it down again or
turn it off when you don't need it.

8d507090-9523-4a8b-a899-0fd33be23d09-0
00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:20.600
The most important thing, oh,
this one as well.

69ece7f3-e0e4-47c1-b3de-4e8b731e5b61-0
00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:23.362
So also remember to,
if you need to oblique the tube,

69ece7f3-e0e4-47c1-b3de-4e8b731e5b61-1
00:24:23.362 --> 00:24:27.200
but it doesn't really matter to what
you're doing which way to oblique it.

70e4ab53-9338-44b5-841e-339bbef2fa5f-0
00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:29.718
Oblique it so that the tube is away from
you,

70e4ab53-9338-44b5-841e-339bbef2fa5f-1
00:24:29.718 --> 00:24:33.520
because that will reduce the amount of
scatter that comes towards you from doing

70e4ab53-9338-44b5-841e-339bbef2fa5f-2
00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:34.600
the oblique projection.

4a7792da-7e63-45e4-a8f0-a9402d6e3d37-0
00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:39.120
Probably the most important thing though,
is distancing.

7c352bf8-e078-4686-ac5e-e9b7f26ab4c4-0
00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:43.320
So doubling your distance reduces the
radiation by a factor of 4.

eed8a6cc-5d2f-4818-a3a3-b9b6e2353f1e-0
00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:45.200
This is known as the inverse square law.

a906d35a-92a3-4934-a040-f42ca668b96e-0
00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:50.191
So even just taking a step back,
particularly during the radiation hungry

a906d35a-92a3-4934-a040-f42ca668b96e-1
00:24:50.191 --> 00:24:53.570
acquisitions of DSA,
makes a really big difference to the

a906d35a-92a3-4934-a040-f42ca668b96e-2
00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:53.919
doors.

5fbd63a1-af77-4405-aa77-8e067c530bbc-0
00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:58.400
So these are things that you can do,
but what about your employer?

8446d9ff-e22c-4341-8182-bccd32c03b07-0
00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:01.808
So in my country,
this is the legislation that pertains to

8446d9ff-e22c-4341-8182-bccd32c03b07-1
00:25:01.808 --> 00:25:03.600
radiation exposure for workers.

6402a107-5b3f-47f7-ad5e-ff5f426f04f7-0
00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:08.560
This is the ionizing radiations
regulations from 2017.

a962fe06-1814-4aab-b35a-48482703f24a-0
00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:12.272
So this will be slightly different
depending on your country,

a962fe06-1814-4aab-b35a-48482703f24a-1
00:25:12.272 --> 00:25:16.443
but I think some reasonable expectations
that you can have of your employer would

a962fe06-1814-4aab-b35a-48482703f24a-2
00:25:16.443 --> 00:25:19.240
be first of all that a risk assessment is
carried out.

26b025c3-819e-4bfe-b20b-70efe35874a6-0
00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:21.600
So this should look at your previous
doses.

08f6cf68-af2c-4f72-94a9-d1ae119b7728-0
00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:27.860
It should estimate what the what the
fetal dose will be over the justicional

08f6cf68-af2c-4f72-94a9-d1ae119b7728-1
00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:32.660
periods and from that then adjust duties
if necessary to to make sure that this

08f6cf68-af2c-4f72-94a9-d1ae119b7728-2
00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:34.400
stays at an acceptable level.

f09de948-6429-4f60-945f-0b8b34c9152e-0
00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:38.796
Where I work,
we're and actually in the UK in general,

f09de948-6429-4f60-945f-0b8b34c9152e-1
00:25:38.796 --> 00:25:43.273
we're provided with an extra decimeter to
where under our PPE at the abdomen a

f09de948-6429-4f60-945f-0b8b34c9152e-2
00:25:43.273 --> 00:25:48.033
level and the estimated dose to the fetus
is set to half of whatever this decimeter

f09de948-6429-4f60-945f-0b8b34c9152e-3
00:25:48.033 --> 00:25:48.600
registers.

eadaee1d-a854-4425-be98-2e207f9d3e3a-0
00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:53.863
You can actually request this monitoring
the the extra decimeter here even before

eadaee1d-a854-4425-be98-2e207f9d3e3a-1
00:25:53.863 --> 00:25:55.040
declaring pregnancy.

64943c63-9066-40f0-be78-51b5b78279dd-0
00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:59.081
So that can be really reassuring for
those who are looking to conceive to be

64943c63-9066-40f0-be78-51b5b78279dd-1
00:25:59.081 --> 00:26:01.720
sure that their doses are not going to
exceed limits.

2d7783fc-2298-4d37-b518-d8131c4cb6f5-0
00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:06.338
Some places may have the option of
electronic dissimiters to get real time

2d7783fc-2298-4d37-b518-d8131c4cb6f5-1
00:26:06.338 --> 00:26:07.800
information and feedback too.

4e6cb268-faa4-49d4-990e-e76461d1c83f-0
00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:12.301
I think it's also reasonable to expect
your employer to make sure you have

4e6cb268-faa4-49d4-990e-e76461d1c83f-1
00:26:12.301 --> 00:26:14.240
appropriate PPE throughout your pregnancy.

37d6e0d2-b9ad-40ad-8d07-efc1be2f7589-0
00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:18.664
The body changes during pregnancy and the
appropriate lead for you at the end of

37d6e0d2-b9ad-40ad-8d07-efc1be2f7589-1
00:26:18.664 --> 00:26:22.440
your pregnancy will not be the lead that
you started off waiting at week 1.

d67f4d8e-24a4-4cf8-81fa-5cfb4a45d7e3-0
00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:28.800
It is not reasonable to expect your
employer to be a mind reader now.

f8db01b0-2954-4978-8671-40afb204b103-0
00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:32.560
They can't take action to protect you if
they don't know that you are pregnant.

f85af833-0029-42f1-9ce2-4a962c23bea4-0
00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.502
And that sometimes means disclosing
earlier than than really you would like

f85af833-0029-42f1-9ce2-4a962c23bea4-1
00:26:37.502 --> 00:26:37.680
to.

9047d4fc-4c33-4093-91da-b63915e7ddd2-0
00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:43.292
But it's important to protect everyone in
the situation and your employer should

9047d4fc-4c33-4093-91da-b63915e7ddd2-1
00:26:43.292 --> 00:26:46.215
really be exercising some sort of
confidential,

9047d4fc-4c33-4093-91da-b63915e7ddd2-2
00:26:46.215 --> 00:26:50.600
some level of confidentiality and it
should be on a need to know basis.

24d7b120-21d7-430b-8d56-17aaafcdea42-0
00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:56.361
So, so far,
I've really presented the facts as we

24d7b120-21d7-430b-8d56-17aaafcdea42-1
00:26:56.361 --> 00:26:59.417
best know them about radiation and
pregnancy,

24d7b120-21d7-430b-8d56-17aaafcdea42-2
00:26:59.417 --> 00:27:04.600
and it's easy to look at this and apply
pure robotic logic and say it's fine.

80af6fb7-aac5-47d9-ac30-b032692d936a-0
00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:06.520
We think the risks are low.

bd8e1787-73dc-458b-86ea-f2baf603388b-0
00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:09.023
As long as you're monitoring things and
taking precautions,

bd8e1787-73dc-458b-86ea-f2baf603388b-1
00:27:09.023 --> 00:27:10.320
there's no need to change anything.

0b5add54-42d6-4a67-847f-759e2338a538-0
00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:15.160
This doesn't take into account several
other factors about our occupational work.

15645d2a-8e4a-4bbd-95d0-e50b78b27d59-0
00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:17.880
So PPE can be heavy and cumbersome.

b1a975fd-cdec-4341-934a-8d5faa10efab-0
00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:20.320
Standing for long periods of time,
waiting.

03f0bd4e-0929-486b-b9b2-facf3f7460e4-0
00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:24.633
It can be fatiguing and challenging even
without simultaneously growing a whole

03f0bd4e-0929-486b-b9b2-facf3f7460e4-1
00:27:24.633 --> 00:27:25.280
human being.

de1cef3f-f91e-4e1c-a13d-f3e79d4de795-0
00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:28.720
And also, we're human, right?

c6937495-d48d-4761-ab81-a41a476a79c2-0
00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:31.600
And humans are more complex than logic.

af612d82-d619-4169-b7ca-575ae4704570-0
00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:36.916
The evidence and facts don't account for
the women who suffered through several

af612d82-d619-4169-b7ca-575ae4704570-1
00:27:36.916 --> 00:27:40.967
miscarriages or a still birth,
or the couple who are unable to get

af612d82-d619-4169-b7ca-575ae4704570-2
00:27:40.967 --> 00:27:45.320
pregnant and have used assisted
conception with only one viable embryo.

fe648d2d-c388-465a-a3a3-8e61744ede52-0
00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:49.009
In occupational situations where there
are other options,

fe648d2d-c388-465a-a3a3-8e61744ede52-1
00:27:49.009 --> 00:27:51.800
these should be available to those who
want to take that route.

e58edfee-e1ab-4691-93d4-0297b1ea9114-0
00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:56.389
In my institution, for example,
our nurses get the option when they

e58edfee-e1ab-4691-93d4-0297b1ea9114-1
00:27:56.389 --> 00:28:01.210
declare pregnancy of choosing to work
within the IR lab or working only in our

e58edfee-e1ab-4691-93d4-0297b1ea9114-2
00:28:01.210 --> 00:28:04.200
admission and recovering recovery
recovery area.

c47146a8-cc14-4931-bea7-f5d286b5db07-0
00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:10.834
Equally, though,
workers should absolutely not be stopped

c47146a8-cc14-4931-bea7-f5d286b5db07-1
00:28:10.834 --> 00:28:13.480
from working in safe situations.

2274c488-4f88-4904-8c59-b7122a545168-0
00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:18.592
Anecdotally,
I know that this has been a barrier for

2274c488-4f88-4904-8c59-b7122a545168-1
00:28:18.592 --> 00:28:22.516
women pursuing careers and interventional
specialties where they've been told,

2274c488-4f88-4904-8c59-b7122a545168-2
00:28:22.516 --> 00:28:24.751
frankly often by men in a position of
power,

2274c488-4f88-4904-8c59-b7122a545168-3
00:28:24.751 --> 00:28:28.080
that they should stay out of the IR lab
now that they're pregnant.

69971fbe-43b9-46f2-8717-8c1675a72414-0
00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:29.320
That is the best thing for them.

57cbf9d8-834e-45c0-985a-3b72be978cbd-0
00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:30.600
It's the best thing for their baby.

9344ba6d-e90f-4815-8851-e7a0dd7b6b16-0
00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:32.760
So that is what that's what they should
do.

796dae1d-dafd-4f96-b672-ca5e54697e2d-0
00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:37.360
This can then lead to them not getting
the required experience and the time

796dae1d-dafd-4f96-b672-ca5e54697e2d-1
00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:41.360
frame that they that they need to for
training and essentially can lead to them

796dae1d-dafd-4f96-b672-ca5e54697e2d-2
00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:44.860
being pushed out and therefore
contributing further to to the lack of

796dae1d-dafd-4f96-b672-ca5e54697e2d-3
00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:46.960
women in some interventional specialities.

3a7ea7ee-e0bd-428f-8e28-786672d5468a-0
00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:51.600
The evidence as we have it right now does
not support this.

63f04f20-982b-4228-a047-124d220e34a7-0
00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:57.166
Pregnancy can be a really highly emotive
time topic and time for people and we

63f04f20-982b-4228-a047-124d220e34a7-1
00:28:57.166 --> 00:29:01.247
should be respectful of that while
acknowledging the facts to and not

63f04f20-982b-4228-a047-124d220e34a7-2
00:29:01.247 --> 00:29:04.280
letting pregnancy be used as an excuse
essentially.

5060bee2-d94f-44c0-b036-50634023ac4a-0
00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:10.505
Thank you very much everyone and I'm
looking forward to taking any questions

5060bee2-d94f-44c0-b036-50634023ac4a-1
00:29:10.505 --> 00:29:12.080
at the question and answer session.

29e22d9b-b8fc-4db4-8028-71a5e56861b8-0
00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:15.520
Good morning.

69d77e49-1a92-4c1f-9b54-8bce590904f3-0
00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:16.840
My name is Alison Sibley.

99c3ca9d-ca99-4797-8278-28ce2bdf4fe4-0
00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:21.840
I am a diagnostic medical physicist as
well as a radiation safety officer.

2367a04e-1eb3-4d35-94b8-07cc04722384-0
00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:28.312
I provide medical physics and RSO
services to the greater South Florida

2367a04e-1eb3-4d35-94b8-07cc04722384-1
00:29:28.312 --> 00:29:28.880
region.

3bf65901-abaf-45ad-896f-ddc753929ff2-0
00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:32.480
The session this morning is called
Scatter Radiation.

fec53a99-fad2-40a9-b3ec-c62db4cbb75c-0
00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:37.080
What You must Know and this mini session
will cover positioning and technique.

de269295-d912-406f-9add-a3545e9dd9ae-0
00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:39.640
Simple changes with a big impact.

07717fc7-0fc8-48e3-a4a5-fecaae2447b8-0
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:48.709
I have nothing to disclose this morning,
so let's start with two position and

07717fc7-0fc8-48e3-a4a5-fecaae2447b8-1
00:29:48.709 --> 00:29:50.000
scatter fields.

bb31cbfe-da29-4e4b-8c2b-d1fad4197e3b-0
00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:55.502
Knowing where the scatter field is
probably one of the most important things

bb31cbfe-da29-4e4b-8c2b-d1fad4197e3b-1
00:29:55.502 --> 00:29:59.965
when it comes to protecting yourself and
to position is going to be a very

bb31cbfe-da29-4e4b-8c2b-d1fad4197e3b-2
00:29:59.965 --> 00:30:03.119
important factor when it comes to scatter
radiation.

3068b6be-6990-43ef-a9ce-e73510d05009-0
00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:07.285
Scatter radiation coming from the patient
is the single largest source of

3068b6be-6990-43ef-a9ce-e73510d05009-1
00:30:07.285 --> 00:30:08.440
occupational exposure.

61f27af1-384b-4940-b5a3-4794d10b71d4-0
00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:14.147
We know that scattered radiation is going
to be greatest towards the side where the

61f27af1-384b-4940-b5a3-4794d10b71d4-1
00:30:14.147 --> 00:30:17.080
X-ray tube or the X-ray beam enters the
patient.

965961c6-50ea-45da-957a-8955e8c4eea5-0
00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:20.871
And in general,
it's important to know that anything that

965961c6-50ea-45da-957a-8955e8c4eea5-1
00:30:20.871 --> 00:30:25.000
is done to reduce patient dose will also
reduce scatter dose or staff dose.

ee93de79-5207-4900-b5f8-a2b75a301273-0
00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:30.000
So let's take a look at tube position.

c22fce15-3f1a-475a-9ce1-e5bb07ca5d8d-0
00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:33.795
First,
I'd like to look at when the X-ray tube

c22fce15-3f1a-475a-9ce1-e5bb07ca5d8d-1
00:30:33.795 --> 00:30:35.120
is under the table.

0beee7fc-c06f-4197-ba80-22e00563404b-0
00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:38.886
In this position,
the greatest scattered radiation levels

0beee7fc-c06f-4197-ba80-22e00563404b-1
00:30:38.886 --> 00:30:40.200
are going to be downward.

556f4492-a3b2-4a58-ab38-86d7ddc90f72-0
00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:45.040
These areas are typically covered by lead
aprons, drapes, and table shielding.

b16f31ca-ac52-412f-90f5-ce46138ff554-0
00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:49.865
In the opposite position,
when the X-ray tube is over the table,

b16f31ca-ac52-412f-90f5-ce46138ff554-1
00:30:49.865 --> 00:30:54.708
you can see that the greater scatter
radiation field is now upward and in this

b16f31ca-ac52-412f-90f5-ce46138ff554-2
00:30:54.708 --> 00:30:58.387
position the eyes,
face and head may receive up to 10 times

b16f31ca-ac52-412f-90f5-ce46138ff554-3
00:30:58.387 --> 00:31:00.840
greater exposure from scatter radiation.

28109819-7e19-4163-98ab-f432b1ac3fa9-0
00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:06.800
Now let's take a look at oblique beam
orientation.

061b76bf-edde-49e9-8f60-73f82d2b91cc-0
00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:08.800
In this position.

1dc00242-0d7b-4500-9382-10cec9934021-0
00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:13.574
Increased patient thickness causes an
increase in the AEC system and this can

1dc00242-0d7b-4500-9382-10cec9934021-1
00:31:13.574 --> 00:31:16.268
drive up the tube energy,
the tube current,

1dc00242-0d7b-4500-9382-10cec9934021-2
00:31:16.268 --> 00:31:19.880
or sometimes even both depending on the
patient thickness.

1ac5ae92-7ad0-4f91-b379-27391587fb82-0
00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:24.383
This dramatically increases the scatter
fields on the X-ray tube side,

1ac5ae92-7ad0-4f91-b379-27391587fb82-1
00:31:24.383 --> 00:31:27.640
which of course is going to increase
radiation exposure to the staff.

0b961ff1-627e-49a8-bff3-5d19e4f61009-0
00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:31.360
The steeper the angulation,
the greater that exposure becomes.

1635db7e-ccb0-48f9-b0de-c9c9b5b9785a-0
00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:35.617
For example,
a 60° angulation may have three times

1635db7e-ccb0-48f9-b0de-c9c9b5b9785a-1
00:31:35.617 --> 00:31:38.640
higher exposure than a 30° angulation.

a908d4bb-9e42-412b-bc06-645cfea7789b-0
00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:43.120
Lastly,
let's look at lateral beam orientation.

201bef28-7ace-4bda-bf2a-8005accfdddf-0
00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:46.817
In this position,
the X-ray beam is traversing the patient

201bef28-7ace-4bda-bf2a-8005accfdddf-1
00:31:46.817 --> 00:31:48.440
in the thickest orientation.

3e9aafc1-3db7-4b97-bdc0-7f6c920c16cd-0
00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:54.187
That higher patient entrance dose to the
to the patient causes a much higher

3e9aafc1-3db7-4b97-bdc0-7f6c920c16cd-1
00:31:54.187 --> 00:31:58.840
scatter fields on the X-ray tube side,
as you can see here on the right.

121d977f-07d4-4bfc-9ade-4f39d3fd290b-0
00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:02.986
When this position is necessary,
it's better to position yourself on the

121d977f-07d4-4bfc-9ade-4f39d3fd290b-1
00:32:02.986 --> 00:32:05.600
image intensifier or the image receptor
side.

22aa152f-5453-4f30-ac82-bbb7c254803c-0
00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:09.114
As you can see,
the scatter field is much lower on the

22aa152f-5453-4f30-ac82-bbb7c254803c-1
00:32:09.114 --> 00:32:10.840
opposing side of the table.

11169b7f-44a0-4e15-ba9d-3e608df62bc7-0
00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:19.089
I have a short video here that can give
you an idea of what the scatter field is

11169b7f-44a0-4e15-ba9d-3e608df62bc7-1
00:32:19.089 --> 00:32:21.800
doing as the beam traverses the patient.

7091b2b6-ae72-4319-a2b3-7ab3443f8e8f-0
00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:26.720
And so we can see here as the X-ray beam
moves into an oblique and lateral

7091b2b6-ae72-4319-a2b3-7ab3443f8e8f-1
00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:29.624
position,
you can see how that scatter field

7091b2b6-ae72-4319-a2b3-7ab3443f8e8f-2
00:32:29.624 --> 00:32:34.852
dramatically increases in size compared
to when the tube is above or beneath the

7091b2b6-ae72-4319-a2b3-7ab3443f8e8f-3
00:32:34.852 --> 00:32:35.240
table.

3b9f7d3f-1203-4fe7-bc86-75708398fd83-0
00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:43.819
One more thing that I'd like to address
before we move on from to position and

3b9f7d3f-1203-4fe7-bc86-75708398fd83-1
00:32:43.819 --> 00:32:47.270
the scatter fields is something that we
call leakage radiation,

3b9f7d3f-1203-4fe7-bc86-75708398fd83-2
00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:49.320
which some people may not be aware of.

ed646ea8-e72d-4fce-8f19-e377f4872530-0
00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:53.932
Leakage radiation from the X-ray tube
housing is another source of occupational

ed646ea8-e72d-4fce-8f19-e377f4872530-1
00:32:53.932 --> 00:32:58.400
exposure and this generally contributes
to about 10 to 20% of occupational dose.

0d458daa-b9c2-42bd-a821-c9425c1194e3-0
00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:02.080
Regulatory limits allow up to 100 Mr.

eb243e93-a429-40b3-8d20-5b56455976ad-0
00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:02.640
per hour.

a311b975-8a67-4806-9b02-7b6abd0c82f1-0
00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:07.120
In my practice,
I haven't seen levels that high.

e1384340-9165-410b-91fb-30760979379f-0
00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:11.261
However,
I have heard from quite a few physicians

e1384340-9165-410b-91fb-30760979379f-1
00:33:11.261 --> 00:33:17.488
that told me that in their training they
were taught to stand behind the X-ray

e1384340-9165-410b-91fb-30760979379f-2
00:33:17.488 --> 00:33:20.720
tube when lateral technique was required.

74fbfc69-44bd-4aa3-923b-173e5dbc6f97-0
00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.840
And so this is your friendly reminder
that you should not be standing next to

74fbfc69-44bd-4aa3-923b-173e5dbc6f97-1
00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:26.120
nor behind the X-ray tube.

64fd08ac-9a8a-4e99-9b77-ba6cfaf87792-0
00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:30.880
For this reason,
let's look at magnification.

2e30bbb0-95a6-449d-836c-9c79b4d798b3-0
00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:34.331
In general,
radiation doses to the patient can

2e30bbb0-95a6-449d-836c-9c79b4d798b3-1
00:33:34.331 --> 00:33:38.312
increase from about 1.
4 to 2 times for each magnification

2e30bbb0-95a6-449d-836c-9c79b4d798b3-2
00:33:38.312 --> 00:33:38.920
position.

600715e1-a2cd-4b87-be81-44b0a1a1b325-0
00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:44.031
Some of the newer interventional systems
can have upwards of five to seven

600715e1-a2cd-4b87-be81-44b0a1a1b325-1
00:33:44.031 --> 00:33:45.320
magnification modes.

5f12a417-8037-41e0-bde7-c316ce2b994d-0
00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:48.560
This can provide a significant radiation
dose to the patient.

e360773d-37ab-4973-a66f-89db0ba52d02-0
00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:53.092
An increase in patient entrance dose is
directly proportional to an increase in

e360773d-37ab-4973-a66f-89db0ba52d02-1
00:33:53.092 --> 00:33:54.240
occupational exposure.

f9332dd1-7293-45e4-a3fd-b9eabec82553-0
00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:57.720
Collimation is another one.

30025784-91aa-499a-8c07-da31bc2eb020-0
00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:02.399
Collimation employs a series of shutters
or wedges that help to block or shape the

30025784-91aa-499a-8c07-da31bc2eb020-1
00:34:02.399 --> 00:34:05.394
primary beam,
and this will allow the physician to only

30025784-91aa-499a-8c07-da31bc2eb020-2
00:34:05.394 --> 00:34:07.480
image the clinical anatomy of interest.

3484abd0-8403-4dab-97e9-12aa67398aff-0
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.589
Some benefits of collimation include less
patient tissue as being irradiated,

3484abd0-8403-4dab-97e9-12aa67398aff-1
00:34:12.589 --> 00:34:15.177
which results in lower dose to the
patient,

3484abd0-8403-4dab-97e9-12aa67398aff-2
00:34:15.177 --> 00:34:20.120
which of course reduces scatter radiation
produced and improves the image contrast.

f48a6b7a-215b-4fd9-8775-296e88da3850-0
00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:25.281
Since less scatter is contributing to the
overall image pulse rates,

f48a6b7a-215b-4fd9-8775-296e88da3850-1
00:34:25.281 --> 00:34:29.920
lower pulse rates deliver less radiation
dose to the patient.

60cf793d-8791-4f21-bdae-bd3014d49d95-0
00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:36.160
Each time the pulse rate is reduced the
patient dose, it decreases by about 25%.

6e574862-046c-4723-ac9d-085313a33982-0
00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:39.040
When dose rate drops,
of course we know scatter rates drop.

ced7f322-648b-4ac7-9b55-2270bd40a592-0
00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:43.411
Always strive to use the lowest pulse
rate that delivers a clinically

ced7f322-648b-4ac7-9b55-2270bd40a592-1
00:34:43.411 --> 00:34:44.760
acceptable image, of course.

ea8f6fb1-568b-481e-9980-0a01d730b012-0
00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:52.080
Let's look at digital subtraction and CNA
imaging.

b1b1b0d3-1694-428c-8cb4-2591faad946d-0
00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:56.574
During CNA imaging,
a single CNA frame delivers about as much

b1b1b0d3-1694-428c-8cb4-2591faad946d-1
00:34:56.574 --> 00:34:59.320
dose to the patient as 10 floral frames.

287c34ac-0c96-4570-b53a-bb2a874ab6a4-0
00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:02.569
In other words,
one minute of CNA is essentially

287c34ac-0c96-4570-b53a-bb2a874ab6a4-1
00:35:02.569 --> 00:35:05.320
equivalent to 10 minutes of fluoroscopy
time.

c0d5b34b-c6fe-42ce-8978-9f9e66df9e22-0
00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:08.813
If available,
low dose rate CNA should be used when it

c0d5b34b-c6fe-42ce-8978-9f9e66df9e22-1
00:35:08.813 --> 00:35:13.200
does not reduce the clinical visibility,
digital subtraction, and geography.

d8604d32-60c0-4bbb-ad3b-a860798dba74-0
00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:18.051
A single DSA frame delivers about as much
dose to the patient as 10 CNA frames,

d8604d32-60c0-4bbb-ad3b-a860798dba74-1
00:35:18.051 --> 00:35:21.280
which we know is equivalent to about 100
floral frames.

6ccafbe7-9bca-4107-bf0f-22c3e3bce80e-0
00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:25.974
DSA images should be acquired at the
lowest clinically usable frame rate and

6ccafbe7-9bca-4107-bf0f-22c3e3bce80e-1
00:35:25.974 --> 00:35:27.480
the shortest time possible.

d859615a-e142-4304-bc84-1adbac1ab9e2-0
00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:33.480
Patient geometry and positioning.

153de9a7-b90b-47be-a606-8f075ec60587-0
00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:37.470
The best practice is going to involve
positioning the patient as close to the

153de9a7-b90b-47be-a606-8f075ec60587-1
00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:38.480
detector as possible.

6cd9bf1c-3572-4c44-85db-f54ae725952e-0
00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:41.131
When the patient is closer to the X-ray
tube,

6cd9bf1c-3572-4c44-85db-f54ae725952e-1
00:35:41.131 --> 00:35:44.800
as seen here in image C on the right,
several factors come into play.

64789377-cc3b-44cd-87a5-9729a9c7bb14-0
00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:47.658
For one,
the patient entrance dose is going to

64789377-cc3b-44cd-87a5-9729a9c7bb14-1
00:35:47.658 --> 00:35:51.280
increase due to the patient's proximity
to the X-ray beam, right?

ac6d54f1-09fe-4dd0-b799-29e285ca4d65-0
00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:54.572
They're closer to the X-ray beam and
that's going to increase their entrance

ac6d54f1-09fe-4dd0-b799-29e285ca4d65-1
00:35:54.572 --> 00:35:55.000
dose rate.

9162fdb2-3a97-483c-aff6-4e7401355fb4-0
00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:58.353
The air gap on the opposite side of the
patient,

9162fdb2-3a97-483c-aff6-4e7401355fb4-1
00:35:58.353 --> 00:36:01.694
between the patient and the image
receptor creates additional space for

9162fdb2-3a97-483c-aff6-4e7401355fb4-2
00:36:01.694 --> 00:36:03.040
scatter on the receptor side.

b138729d-15d8-4417-86ee-e2326fc424ee-0
00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:06.527
That scatter of course,
is going to increase the dose to the

b138729d-15d8-4417-86ee-e2326fc424ee-1
00:36:06.527 --> 00:36:09.640
staff and it's also going to degrade the
overall image quality.

d92edd8d-bf03-4fad-95d7-98a6a3a9b90a-0
00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:16.024
Also keep this in mind when alternating
views into the ladder and lateral and

d92edd8d-bf03-4fad-95d7-98a6a3a9b90a-1
00:36:16.024 --> 00:36:18.680
oblique positioning and also in the
biplane set up.

99fbfb02-dbac-4e93-b6fc-87aefb1791df-0
00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:23.221
The patient should always be kept as
close to the image receptor or receptors

99fbfb02-dbac-4e93-b6fc-87aefb1791df-1
00:36:23.221 --> 00:36:23.920
as possible.

60f3626a-5adc-44a4-bd15-ba4a83cff4e9-0
00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:27.600
It's easy to forget this step when you
move the beam to a different geometry.

08343dc1-e087-4bc9-95d2-2ccce85379cd-0
00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:32.762
And to summarize,
most techniques that reduce the entrance

08343dc1-e087-4bc9-95d2-2ccce85379cd-1
00:36:32.762 --> 00:36:36.040
dose to the patient will result in lower
doses to the staph as well.

1d40a816-cdcd-4e9e-b7a8-3951ddefbb32-0
00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:38.080
Be mindful of X-ray 2 placement.

94fb66bf-fc93-4d90-8f29-913eea8411d5-0
00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:40.349
If the X-ray tube is placed above the
table,

94fb66bf-fc93-4d90-8f29-913eea8411d5-1
00:36:40.349 --> 00:36:44.332
be sure to use portable shielding to
protect the staph head and eye exposures,

94fb66bf-fc93-4d90-8f29-913eea8411d5-2
00:36:44.332 --> 00:36:47.559
and this also applies to oblique and
lateral positions as well.

7c34dc62-090b-444c-ab8c-a83366e243fe-0
00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:49.880
Limit magnification use.

ae63ba35-96e5-40c0-a5f8-1233410113b7-0
00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:54.080
Use collimation to image only the
essential anatomy of clinical interest.

1df2f333-5a76-43e8-8b1d-073477616a79-0
00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:55.280
Lower pulse rates.

04cb8c99-9212-4d28-be8b-6c0da604ae14-0
00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:56.360
Whenever practical.

bbc80243-a754-4605-980a-51cfae327ce2-0
00:36:56.640 --> 00:37:00.921
DSA and CNA acquisitions should be used
sparingly and always place the image

bbc80243-a754-4605-980a-51cfae327ce2-1
00:37:00.921 --> 00:37:03.480
receptor as close to the patient as
possible.

6129e748-7646-4fe2-8928-36109fc33e9d-0
00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:06.160
Thank you.

35a914ec-fab6-4f6e-9070-c37d65c7d17f-0
00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:10.680
Thank you everyone and and welcome back.

041be772-ea36-49de-acee-029162641bb4-0
00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:15.720
They two really started off fantastically
with this great panel.

e54e5269-efde-4462-97a8-a5302fc42f86-0
00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:20.960
Just just heard some great talks on
protecting women in practice.

72459ca4-8ab4-44c8-85d0-a1b445c8f4b1-0
00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:25.540
And I want to bring, you know,
these questions are this panel is really

72459ca4-8ab4-44c8-85d0-a1b445c8f4b1-1
00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:28.000
for everyone who is who is on the call.

367c2ebd-ade8-494f-aae0-5f465fcdcab3-0
00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:31.040
And so we really want everyone to be
involved.

06662bc5-70cf-4462-a4e9-823db5def338-0
00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:33.960
If you have a question,
just put the question in.

6f22dfb4-e399-4a86-836c-092598e25dbc-0
00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:41.343
Certainly we're going to we're going to
dive into some to some deep dialogue

6f22dfb4-e399-4a86-836c-092598e25dbc-1
00:37:41.343 --> 00:37:45.446
joined here by my Co Co director Bella
Housing,

6f22dfb4-e399-4a86-836c-092598e25dbc-2
00:37:45.446 --> 00:37:50.320
interventional radiologist and and and
vascular surgeon.

3e9dfe03-c4c5-49aa-8405-cb13208110e6-0
00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:52.400
Lot of expertise in this area.

051d097a-e4a7-4a61-8829-f26cffe17e94-0
00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:58.169
We have Linda Watkins who is a consultant
pediatric interventional radiologist as

051d097a-e4a7-4a61-8829-f26cffe17e94-1
00:37:58.169 --> 00:37:59.720
well from from Glasgow.

dd7d82ca-98ac-4828-90d7-f7cf3e60ff25-0
00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:04.916
We have doctor Rhian Davies,
complex interventional coronary operator,

dd7d82ca-98ac-4828-90d7-f7cf3e60ff25-1
00:38:04.916 --> 00:38:08.381
South Span, Pennsylvania,
to Ryan complex interventional

dd7d82ca-98ac-4828-90d7-f7cf3e60ff25-2
00:38:08.381 --> 00:38:11.360
cardiologist again from Baylor,
Scott and White.

ce0a1d52-c28c-4d2f-a399-d45f4e9f926f-0
00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:13.000
And then Allison Sipley.

cf7a327f-a099-46eb-8441-260bd03f0f8b-0
00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:17.840
She is a medical physicist and radiation
safety officer in in Florida.

7579546e-d28f-4d92-b135-126d30fd749c-0
00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:21.129
So, so Bella, if you want to,
if you want to take it away and start

7579546e-d28f-4d92-b135-126d30fd749c-1
00:38:21.129 --> 00:38:23.520
asking some questions,
I got a few of my own as well.

66ff5aa8-eed3-4ec8-982b-f6511347c71b-0
00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:25.480
Yeah, no, thank you.

a9dd0b04-97ed-48a8-a8f4-94e1d3ff1f50-0
00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:27.440
Thank you so much to all our speakers.

1a2ae1dc-a424-4c28-840a-e7d6bcdd15c8-0
00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:30.400
This is wonderful to have such a variety
in a mix.

f4076c25-de0d-465a-9cea-35ea6b6652b1-0
00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:33.680
Now I've got few selfish questions for me.

43d9b983-5076-4395-a2d9-07e93c11d15a-0
00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:39.398
Ladies, in terms of your training,
whether it be doctor or non medical,

43d9b983-5076-4395-a2d9-07e93c11d15a-1
00:38:39.398 --> 00:38:45.396
what would you say the biggest advocates
and the help that you got that allowed

43d9b983-5076-4395-a2d9-07e93c11d15a-2
00:38:45.396 --> 00:38:50.720
you to maintain your profession and
maintain confidence in this field?

44df7f11-7e96-4c68-abdd-43fe583612f7-0
00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:55.623
Just because I know we've got lots of
young female audience here and I guess

44df7f11-7e96-4c68-abdd-43fe583612f7-1
00:38:55.623 --> 00:38:58.840
they need somebody to look up to and
ideas for support.

b9d4b21f-1f6a-4308-8fbc-14ee0f292a3d-0
00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:02.760
So if there's anything you would like to
share in that term, I'd be very grateful.

18593f87-9457-4a4e-905b-570b07779b0b-0
00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:13.600
I don't mind opening up.

cc417604-9b73-4949-8d5b-0e4a1527ab68-0
00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:18.640
So I think for me actually it was,
it was actually my male colleagues.

b23eb961-93d5-49e1-82b4-3d7e82ca85e5-0
00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:24.387
So I went through the the whole of my
interventional radiology training as the

b23eb961-93d5-49e1-82b4-3d7e82ca85e5-1
00:39:24.387 --> 00:39:26.240
only woman in my department.

b9f33b8b-f353-4194-82b3-c6a2ccc72bf3-0
00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:30.920
I'm the first female IR consultant in my
department and things as well.

af49cc25-dd1b-4119-99dc-d71c66f6c032-0
00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:35.098
But honestly,
it just kind of felt like it didn't

af49cc25-dd1b-4119-99dc-d71c66f6c032-1
00:39:35.098 --> 00:39:35.560
matter.

ce3c7840-2dfa-42ae-b59b-f76e90beae67-0
00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:39.080
It was never, you know,
it was never a big deal to the men that I

ce3c7840-2dfa-42ae-b59b-f76e90beae67-1
00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:39.720
worked with.

876f16cb-d232-45b2-af99-c4b14520c2ae-0
00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:43.360
The they were always very good.

517b8697-8ffe-4e05-8451-4e36d27e77cf-0
00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:48.768
I think a lot of them are also married to
women who are in medical careers and

517b8697-8ffe-4e05-8451-4e36d27e77cf-1
00:39:48.768 --> 00:39:50.480
things like that as well.

7474d64d-471e-4fbf-9de6-e16041ac11f6-0
00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:55.438
And so it was never a department of men
whose wives did all of the work at home

7474d64d-471e-4fbf-9de6-e16041ac11f6-1
00:39:55.438 --> 00:39:58.226
and did all the child raising and,
you know,

7474d64d-471e-4fbf-9de6-e16041ac11f6-2
00:39:58.226 --> 00:40:00.520
and kind of things like that as well.

253e315b-03b8-4526-b190-0dce2c89caaa-0
00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:03.647
So even my male colleagues, trainees,
you know,

253e315b-03b8-4526-b190-0dce2c89caaa-1
00:40:03.647 --> 00:40:06.774
at at whatever time they would say to
them, oh,

253e315b-03b8-4526-b190-0dce2c89caaa-2
00:40:06.774 --> 00:40:09.119
are are you a nursery pick up today?

f791560b-c4a0-4296-a258-a5713b32b319-0
00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:10.400
Do you need to go?

3d4c51f7-347b-456f-bbd3-c3005a124498-0
00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:15.132
And we've just always had that,
that it didn't matter what the gender of

3d4c51f7-347b-456f-bbd3-c3005a124498-1
00:40:15.132 --> 00:40:16.080
the person was.

a8ebaf2e-6a6f-4bc8-be4c-6b1ac7854429-0
00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:22.074
There was a recognition of work life
balance of the the extra medical and

a8ebaf2e-6a6f-4bc8-be4c-6b1ac7854429-1
00:40:22.074 --> 00:40:22.560
extra.

15554f25-9048-4cbf-a63d-97904703ad53-0
00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:28.840
Work commitments that everyone had and
therefore that was applied to everyone.

f12f2771-ea25-405c-8afe-a26e59a59dda-0
00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:32.974
And I think that actually made a really
big difference in feeling,

f12f2771-ea25-405c-8afe-a26e59a59dda-1
00:40:32.974 --> 00:40:36.400
in feeling like your your male colleagues
are on your side as well.

d9bc6b5d-4e81-4175-963e-73a1f182738b-0
00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:38.520
I agree with you, Linda.

e547d8e9-b2b7-406d-9366-ed981e8a8282-0
00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:44.295
I think as I've gone through training,
I started probably in a very much male

e547d8e9-b2b7-406d-9366-ed981e8a8282-1
00:40:44.295 --> 00:40:48.960
dominated specialty around me in the
general cardiology realm.

d0b76d8a-56fb-4a34-83ab-578768af54ee-0
00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:51.533
And then when I got to do my
interventional year,

d0b76d8a-56fb-4a34-83ab-578768af54ee-1
00:40:51.533 --> 00:40:54.880
I had a female mentor and that was like
my first exposure to it.

8a70e592-a5ff-435b-923c-934e71e303b7-0
00:40:54.880 --> 00:41:00.800
And now I think the female space within
interventional cardiology is growing.

98cf233e-fd26-47d0-bb4d-424c473764ea-0
00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:04.828
So we look around at conferences and we
look around in the workplace and there's

98cf233e-fd26-47d0-bb4d-424c473764ea-1
00:41:04.828 --> 00:41:06.320
more and more of us out there.

c1a20f4c-ea6d-4fd5-984c-6e6031c42668-0
00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:10.047
So it's kind of incredible,
but I think that mentorship probably

c1a20f4c-ea6d-4fd5-984c-6e6031c42668-1
00:41:10.047 --> 00:41:12.800
started more so from the our male
counterparts.

12ddd344-59cd-4b18-8b0b-66be37688224-0
00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:16.166
But as time is going on,
I think we're starting to see more and

12ddd344-59cd-4b18-8b0b-66be37688224-1
00:41:16.166 --> 00:41:17.640
more female faces out there.

05f80b53-90e5-43a0-b5e3-ac2a8b7966d9-0
00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:18.400
So it's great.

dd8ab904-f835-4df7-b2b5-e301df39ec0c-0
00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:19.640
Yeah.

c2ae3d9c-789c-4f83-950d-7d7548be9339-0
00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:20.080
Thank you.

ef9c7e21-3d2a-4bc3-9088-5cf4430414fc-0
00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:23.115
Doctor Davies and Doctor Watkins,
I agree with both of the things that you

ef9c7e21-3d2a-4bc3-9088-5cf4430414fc-1
00:41:23.115 --> 00:41:23.520
guys said.

9452b846-cfd0-4596-b588-a6115570d1ac-0
00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:28.298
But I would also like to add that some of
our biggest support as early trainees and

9452b846-cfd0-4596-b588-a6115570d1ac-1
00:41:28.298 --> 00:41:31.029
women trainees are,
are actually the Cath labs,

9452b846-cfd0-4596-b588-a6115570d1ac-2
00:41:31.029 --> 00:41:35.580
scrub techs and nurses that have been in
the lab and been around radiation much

9452b846-cfd0-4596-b588-a6115570d1ac-3
00:41:35.580 --> 00:41:38.880
more than we have as we've entered our
our careers there.

746cd791-1d59-44fe-a804-c72411831740-0
00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:43.960
And they have seen kind of where
radiation protection has gone from and to.

c4c817f0-5bd6-4049-90d1-5cbb97d60e52-0
00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:48.846
I think they are also equally excited to
see that evolution as we move the space

c4c817f0-5bd6-4049-90d1-5cbb97d60e52-1
00:41:48.846 --> 00:41:53.160
forward for protecting not only those at
the table, but all of those around us.

20be4dda-655d-435e-a752-c96d34599db3-0
00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:56.797
So I think that's a great source of
support as well our our staff members

20be4dda-655d-435e-a752-c96d34599db3-1
00:41:56.797 --> 00:41:59.600
that have been in the lab for a lot
longer than we have.

88faf201-7a7b-4271-8beb-3c629f11f706-0
00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:04.000
Thank you guys.

8ea85024-c0fb-487c-b133-497089d85976-0
00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:09.120
What would you say your biggest challenge
thus far in your career being a woman?

56751a42-746a-426b-a225-714a15a60469-0
00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:12.243
And within that challenge,
what tools or what,

56751a42-746a-426b-a225-714a15a60469-1
00:42:12.243 --> 00:42:14.360
how did you manage to navigate them?

9ef505d5-5cbf-4397-840a-f9d9d75818bb-0
00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:18.945
If you don't mind sharing that experience
just in case if there's a youngster or

9ef505d5-5cbf-4397-840a-f9d9d75818bb-1
00:42:18.945 --> 00:42:21.606
somebody going through similar challenges
now,

9ef505d5-5cbf-4397-840a-f9d9d75818bb-2
00:42:21.606 --> 00:42:25.400
maybe they can find inspiration or or
utilize these similar tools.

2b5d33e0-0736-4811-9e80-ddfb78395c37-0
00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:28.440
I think that's a great question.

a52aa8cb-df93-4767-9cea-efbf500097a1-0
00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:32.780
And to be honest with you,
when I first announced to my general

a52aa8cb-df93-4767-9cea-efbf500097a1-1
00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:37.528
cardiology fellowship that I wanted to
enter interventional cardiology,

a52aa8cb-df93-4767-9cea-efbf500097a1-2
00:42:37.528 --> 00:42:40.760
I was quickly told that is no place for a
woman.

87283a7a-a835-40bc-b280-f38dad84079d-0
00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:44.072
And the,
the main barrier there that they felt was

87283a7a-a835-40bc-b280-f38dad84079d-1
00:42:44.072 --> 00:42:47.736
truly the radiation exposure,
maybe a little bit of the work life

87283a7a-a835-40bc-b280-f38dad84079d-2
00:42:47.736 --> 00:42:52.290
balance and the concern that it's going
to be really hard to have a family and be

87283a7a-a835-40bc-b280-f38dad84079d-3
00:42:52.290 --> 00:42:55.400
on call every other night,
which is truly not the case.

42e21b2a-cf1d-48b0-9203-f2544430212f-0
00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:58.835
But with that being said,
I think it's sometimes a matter of

42e21b2a-cf1d-48b0-9203-f2544430212f-1
00:42:58.835 --> 00:43:03.171
finding the folks that truly believe in
you and know that this career is for

42e21b2a-cf1d-48b0-9203-f2544430212f-2
00:43:03.171 --> 00:43:05.480
everybody or anybody that wants to do it.

1c8fce94-cb69-4553-92e2-c198dcdf4518-0
00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:09.980
And then, you know,
maybe maybe having a little bit of thick

1c8fce94-cb69-4553-92e2-c198dcdf4518-1
00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:13.137
skin too, and,
and hearing those comments and ignoring

1c8fce94-cb69-4553-92e2-c198dcdf4518-2
00:43:13.137 --> 00:43:17.040
them as you kind of steer ahead with a
focus on entering the space.

8868a247-e2bb-4fff-b213-849e11316bb5-0
00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:21.880
Yeah, I would second that.

84ec367c-0b4a-4452-93c8-4cf76b52268a-0
00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:22.680
Sorry.

96c87ca6-5798-4591-aaae-e95ad93ca06f-0
00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:24.320
No, no, go right ahead, Doctor.

c9002dad-fa2e-4c5a-a56c-746688a7ad5d-0
00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:26.618
I would, I would second that,
Doctor Davies,

c9002dad-fa2e-4c5a-a56c-746688a7ad5d-1
00:43:26.618 --> 00:43:30.500
even in the medical physics field,
there's very few female radiation safety

c9002dad-fa2e-4c5a-a56c-746688a7ad5d-2
00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:30.960
officers.

9c990b81-4a81-42c8-8e74-e75669d5554c-0
00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:32.920
There's very few female medical
physicists.

9a10abea-9c77-4401-9872-0ae25d0d2ada-0
00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:35.720
And I think the times are changing, right?

405f6138-152d-4d6b-a891-32e45028f453-0
00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:39.522
In more recent years,
we're starting to see more women in the

405f6138-152d-4d6b-a891-32e45028f453-1
00:43:39.522 --> 00:43:40.840
field, more women in practice.

fa7b6c4b-0999-47b1-ab93-f6be39c71e79-0
00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:46.080
But yeah, it's,
it's if you don't break the molds, right?

9def9c00-ae2d-4155-93d9-7fc384fa7526-0
00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:50.440
And you don't cut through that barrier,
no one else will, right?

1de7ad1f-badd-4835-94a7-66855c7e25f4-0
00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:54.703
And so even if we don't see faces like
our own when we start in our career,

1de7ad1f-badd-4835-94a7-66855c7e25f4-1
00:43:54.703 --> 00:43:58.910
there's no reason why we we can't push
through and and be the first be the

1de7ad1f-badd-4835-94a7-66855c7e25f4-2
00:43:58.910 --> 00:43:59.920
mentor for others.

b79192a7-f424-4b70-bd00-76f8de421716-0
00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:00.240
Right.

3755c4f6-0b24-4570-9281-adcd34132fc2-0
00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:03.200
Thank you.

47a9e1b3-f110-4b87-9a10-2ee891b20812-0
00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:03.400
Yeah.

b2f0552a-6a55-4932-9776-fc8d8c340bb9-0
00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:07.234
I was just going to say that sometimes
just being a woman, my height,

b2f0552a-6a55-4932-9776-fc8d8c340bb9-1
00:44:07.234 --> 00:44:11.780
I'm probably most women are a little bit
shorter than our male counterparts in the

b2f0552a-6a55-4932-9776-fc8d8c340bb9-2
00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:12.000
lab.

1f2152ff-4adf-475f-bb1a-6e11439df148-0
00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:17.321
And so I think a physical barrier was was
just being a sort of vertically

1f2152ff-4adf-475f-bb1a-6e11439df148-1
00:44:17.321 --> 00:44:18.760
challenged operator.

51f0dd0c-4f66-4786-9084-55b623d0204c-0
00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:23.327
But I think as we open the conversation
of what Doctor Davies said,

51f0dd0c-4f66-4786-9084-55b623d0204c-1
00:44:23.327 --> 00:44:26.272
how she was told it just wasn't a place
for women,

51f0dd0c-4f66-4786-9084-55b623d0204c-2
00:44:26.272 --> 00:44:29.680
changing that conversation to it can be a
place for women.

20250c51-93ac-4b7c-a0cf-33b2c4cf80d1-0
00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:30.920
It is a place for women.

6678976e-a310-48c9-b87b-a3e6da28b515-0
00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:34.040
And then how do we continue to make it
and even and better place for women?

68e1cba1-1670-496b-acbd-4db8c1b93ae4-0
00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:42.514
I think as well as that,
I think you're totally right that women

68e1cba1-1670-496b-acbd-4db8c1b93ae4-1
00:44:42.514 --> 00:44:45.120
supporting women is a huge part of this.

cb6af415-de9a-43cc-8f4a-25270842a9b9-0
00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:49.490
Because actually, if you,
if I answer very honestly in terms of

cb6af415-de9a-43cc-8f4a-25270842a9b9-1
00:44:49.490 --> 00:44:54.680
what were the biggest barriers to me
doing IR, it was probably other women.

adb30a6e-043a-43e7-87bc-f261ef384561-0
00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:59.851
It was women in the diagnostic sphere of
radiology who told me that, that, that,

adb30a6e-043a-43e7-87bc-f261ef384561-1
00:44:59.851 --> 00:45:02.720
you know,
or was I really sure and how you'll

adb30a6e-043a-43e7-87bc-f261ef384561-2
00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:06.650
change your mind and you might want to
rethink that, you know,

adb30a6e-043a-43e7-87bc-f261ef384561-3
00:45:06.650 --> 00:45:07.959
and things like that.

669fd483-21fc-477a-955b-bbb63bd6bb52-0
00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:10.925
It was never anyone in the interventional
space actually, you know,

669fd483-21fc-477a-955b-bbb63bd6bb52-1
00:45:10.925 --> 00:45:13.760
like I said that, you know,
my male colleagues there were always

669fd483-21fc-477a-955b-bbb63bd6bb52-2
00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:14.720
incredibly supportive.

73266db1-7466-49cc-8b61-278923b981fc-0
00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:18.862
But actually, I found that it was,
it was other women who had different

73266db1-7466-49cc-8b61-278923b981fc-1
00:45:18.862 --> 00:45:22.602
goals, different ideas,
different different perspectives of what

73266db1-7466-49cc-8b61-278923b981fc-2
00:45:22.602 --> 00:45:26.400
they wanted for their life,
actually trying to impose that on me.

092c678c-03cf-4217-8704-cc609f273192-0
00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:30.020
And,
and I think that really kind of opened my

092c678c-03cf-4217-8704-cc609f273192-1
00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:34.890
eyes into just how important it is to,
to really just make sure that you're not

092c678c-03cf-4217-8704-cc609f273192-2
00:45:34.890 --> 00:45:35.560
dismissive.

fe45b848-9099-476d-959d-d4b3df0f50e4-0
00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:37.945
You know, even if someone come, you know,
a,

fe45b848-9099-476d-959d-d4b3df0f50e4-1
00:45:37.945 --> 00:45:42.291
a junior can come along and say that they
want to do something that to you sounds

fe45b848-9099-476d-959d-d4b3df0f50e4-2
00:45:42.291 --> 00:45:44.200
like the most boring thing on earth.

e862eb2a-9005-4dc1-a4ca-9f2f9b822b2a-0
00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:48.192
But you can still be positive to them
about that and encourage them,

e862eb2a-9005-4dc1-a4ca-9f2f9b822b2a-1
00:45:48.192 --> 00:45:50.160
encourage them in that and things.

d75ed7a9-15da-4f12-b451-c9c5ff32b342-0
00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:54.691
And I think that's really important,
particularly in a space like this that is

d75ed7a9-15da-4f12-b451-c9c5ff32b342-1
00:45:54.691 --> 00:45:56.240
still quite male dominated.

c8effd1a-eef0-4ecb-8d6d-094c58529309-0
00:45:57.640 --> 00:46:02.132
Yeah, I think from my end,
it's just to add to say that it's OK for

c8effd1a-eef0-4ecb-8d6d-094c58529309-1
00:46:02.132 --> 00:46:03.520
it to be challenging.

32d765f5-2508-4067-afa3-529c7acc604f-0
00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:07.920
It's OK to struggle to balance family
life with IR.

32f0be55-a079-4011-93e2-d980d2852e08-0
00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:12.623
It's OK that some weeks are horrendous
between on call and managing life outside

32f0be55-a079-4011-93e2-d980d2852e08-1
00:46:12.623 --> 00:46:13.320
the on call.

fead2bfd-c229-448a-b001-9e86ce579dae-0
00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:15.800
But not every single woman's the same.

0043de38-08b2-4d2b-a251-a90705b27340-0
00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:16.920
Everybody's different.

bd3912d8-97de-47df-82ce-25eca9d6a99d-0
00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:18.480
Their support system is different.

7297089e-af5e-4e6b-bb8d-931604a0c06b-0
00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:22.840
And what might be easy peasy for me may
not necessarily be for XY and Z.

a208058e-c3da-4467-a8de-f114468f1b95-0
00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:26.508
So definitely agree with the support,
just be happy,

a208058e-c3da-4467-a8de-f114468f1b95-1
00:46:26.508 --> 00:46:31.319
provide that support and let that junior
decide for themselves if that future

a208058e-c3da-4467-a8de-f114468f1b95-2
00:46:31.319 --> 00:46:34.280
works for them and empower them with the
tools.

23c29f9d-916a-4342-bab6-7975f546f2a9-0
00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:37.841
I think,
and I'm glad that there is now more flexi

23c29f9d-916a-4342-bab6-7975f546f2a9-1
00:46:37.841 --> 00:46:38.400
working.

edcb1c2f-cfda-4d3c-a294-a21b13c03f20-0
00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:42.720
There's a lot more availability of part
time because everything passes.

8d316249-0b33-4ac7-9206-75e4b7f3e15d-0
00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:46.395
We go through phases in life where you
may want part time for that period of

8d316249-0b33-4ac7-9206-75e4b7f3e15d-1
00:46:46.395 --> 00:46:48.400
time and then you'll go back to full time.

ce698ce6-39c4-4eb0-b6df-7035434dc56b-0
00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:49.360
It's it's normal.

7521f7ab-880d-495d-ab56-fd581239b0c2-0
00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:50.360
Everybody's different.

5fee93af-794c-4faf-8bc1-8f3f13822dec-0
00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:53.211
Some may need it,
some may absolutely not need it,

5fee93af-794c-4faf-8bc1-8f3f13822dec-1
00:46:53.211 --> 00:46:55.280
but we won't know unless we're in it.

ae191db9-9f76-4665-bc7f-611d95d22251-0
00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:58.789
And to be in it,
we have to be allowed to be in it or at

ae191db9-9f76-4665-bc7f-611d95d22251-1
00:46:58.789 --> 00:47:01.000
least given the opportunity to be in it.

aabf5de5-f1dd-408f-94bf-8a176774dd81-0
00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:05.280
And that's my message for anybody
watching this, not, don't be disheartened.

902ad726-3bb4-4657-b176-351456c9cebd-0
00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:07.680
Don't think it, it will be an easy ride.

401e3aed-279b-47b7-82c6-de09f12ef6e3-0
00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:10.120
It may not be,
but then it may be a very easy ride.

f56abf69-3128-48db-9283-5a9d6fa6c283-0
00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:15.286
We don't know that that will be for you
to decide and work out,

f56abf69-3128-48db-9283-5a9d6fa6c283-1
00:47:15.286 --> 00:47:18.920
but definitely we'll be here to support
Bob.

fa1257e9-c3ed-42f3-926c-cbc40fe7a80c-0
00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:23.960
Do you have any questions before I end up
selfishly taking more of my own questions?

b851e6d9-98f3-4d53-9d71-9c8915c20c9c-0
00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:25.240
I know you've had some.

0f8b1cae-bb29-4286-acf8-adce9684fd86-0
00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:27.200
I absolutely did.

61c965c2-934f-4341-a4fd-7a84688de842-0
00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:30.131
And I'm certainly not worthy to be with
this group,

61c965c2-934f-4341-a4fd-7a84688de842-1
00:47:30.131 --> 00:47:33.120
but I represent our certainly our male
counterparts.

202f7b06-ce57-4262-938d-e32fe9f28e5d-0
00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:36.438
You know,
I do think that that it is really a

202f7b06-ce57-4262-938d-e32fe9f28e5d-1
00:47:36.438 --> 00:47:40.120
tragedy that we don't have more women in
these fields.

e5f8d794-94d2-4460-aa3a-6fd4ff08b979-0
00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:44.045
I think we're missing an enormous amount
of talent and, and for cardiology,

e5f8d794-94d2-4460-aa3a-6fd4ff08b979-1
00:47:44.045 --> 00:47:46.421
I don't know what it's like across the
world,

e5f8d794-94d2-4460-aa3a-6fd4ff08b979-2
00:47:46.421 --> 00:47:49.417
but certainly in the US and for
cardiology, it, you know,

e5f8d794-94d2-4460-aa3a-6fd4ff08b979-3
00:47:49.417 --> 00:47:50.760
it's down in the 4% range.

0e6b5b07-2ed5-4bea-a05c-0e376aa78f0b-0
00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:55.987
And so we're really missing a lot of,
a lot of really good frontline hands on

0e6b5b07-2ed5-4bea-a05c-0e376aa78f0b-1
00:47:55.987 --> 00:47:56.680
talent now.

f1b3a51e-6074-44a1-844d-c44cb8c372f5-0
00:47:56.880 --> 00:48:01.495
You know, our staff is really dominated,
I think by women and they're getting more

f1b3a51e-6074-44a1-844d-c44cb8c372f5-1
00:48:01.495 --> 00:48:04.720
radiation than we are because they're in
there every day.

c80acc2b-d13a-4e6c-b183-76849a2afea8-0
00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:07.736
And, and to,
I think the Doctor Ryan's point,

c80acc2b-d13a-4e6c-b183-76849a2afea8-1
00:48:07.736 --> 00:48:11.035
I thought it was very interesting just
talking about the,

c80acc2b-d13a-4e6c-b183-76849a2afea8-2
00:48:11.035 --> 00:48:15.414
the shorter stature and, and, you know,
the inability to really to raise the

c80acc2b-d13a-4e6c-b183-76849a2afea8-3
00:48:15.414 --> 00:48:18.600
table because you have to be comfortable
in these labs.

8c22ecb7-621e-4d86-aba8-e5b6d7dc5674-0
00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:23.200
And I think it's it, you know,
creates more radiation.

6fe3fa5c-a3f3-48b5-ba80-a8972f6cbda7-0
00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:30.432
And so should there be something that
either in the designs and the new designs

6fe3fa5c-a3f3-48b5-ba80-a8972f6cbda7-1
00:48:30.432 --> 00:48:35.642
of some of these imaging,
imaging technologies or certainly now

6fe3fa5c-a3f3-48b5-ba80-a8972f6cbda7-2
00:48:35.642 --> 00:48:41.992
that we have newer technologies for,
for blocking radiation and reducing your

6fe3fa5c-a3f3-48b5-ba80-a8972f6cbda7-3
00:48:41.992 --> 00:48:42.400
risk.

61d48d03-8133-4881-aea7-f4bbc32be01f-0
00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:47.734
I guess my question is how do you think
we can go forward to make it a safer

61d48d03-8133-4881-aea7-f4bbc32be01f-1
00:48:47.734 --> 00:48:49.760
place even it's safer than it is now?

e64e8d56-3598-4910-846e-a4e1bdb88bb8-0
00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:54.052
What do you think are like the first
steps and second steps and maybe some

e64e8d56-3598-4910-846e-a4e1bdb88bb8-1
00:48:54.052 --> 00:48:58.517
long term steps that we can get so that
five years from now it's a much safer

e64e8d56-3598-4910-846e-a4e1bdb88bb8-2
00:48:58.517 --> 00:49:00.120
place for women to practice?

71af7fd6-5f04-48e1-adfb-4759658599ae-0
00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:05.880
I think a big step of that is,
is research alone.

b9c140a5-5a13-4189-9595-00c0cdeea500-0
00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:08.886
You know,
I know there's been a lot of smaller

b9c140a5-5a13-4189-9595-00c0cdeea500-1
00:49:08.886 --> 00:49:14.003
studies that have been done out there
with wearing dose radiation badges on our

b9c140a5-5a13-4189-9595-00c0cdeea500-2
00:49:14.003 --> 00:49:19.056
gowns and that sort of thing and using
different protective devices between US

b9c140a5-5a13-4189-9595-00c0cdeea500-3
00:49:19.056 --> 00:49:20.720
and the radiation systems.

69f5d257-55e4-42a0-880e-03bc72d7ee75-0
00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:25.545
But I think more that are dedicated to
female and for folks that are maybe

69f5d257-55e4-42a0-880e-03bc72d7ee75-1
00:49:25.545 --> 00:49:30.563
pregnant and in the radiation space,
just to give that reassurance that it is

69f5d257-55e4-42a0-880e-03bc72d7ee75-2
00:49:30.563 --> 00:49:31.400
in fact safe.

56386d6f-5838-470f-8af3-f3f6ead1c8c8-0
00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:34.374
I think the more data that is collected
with time,

56386d6f-5838-470f-8af3-f3f6ead1c8c8-1
00:49:34.374 --> 00:49:37.640
the more reassurance that women entering
the space are,

56386d6f-5838-470f-8af3-f3f6ead1c8c8-2
00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:40.440
are good to go and there shouldn't be any
fear.

9efd4780-c93d-4f0d-a6ec-bc6d49a43a74-0
00:49:46.180 --> 00:49:50.764
And I think forums like the ones we're
having this weekend, I think group chats,

9efd4780-c93d-4f0d-a6ec-bc6d49a43a74-1
00:49:50.764 --> 00:49:53.991
I think, you know,
speciality breakout sessions at these

9efd4780-c93d-4f0d-a6ec-bc6d49a43a74-2
00:49:53.991 --> 00:49:58.180
conferences that we all attend to bring
up this topic is super important.

a7bcafef-80aa-4b1d-a80f-ec7c5b7559e3-0
00:49:58.180 --> 00:50:02.237
I think the narrative has always been I
can't work in the Cath lab because I want

a7bcafef-80aa-4b1d-a80f-ec7c5b7559e3-1
00:50:02.237 --> 00:50:02.980
to be pregnant.

c3eb8435-c9e4-4094-91ce-f718c334db29-0
00:50:03.380 --> 00:50:06.126
Well,
we've seen that data has come out and

c3eb8435-c9e4-4094-91ce-f718c334db29-1
00:50:06.126 --> 00:50:09.435
we've seen with proper techniques,
proper shielding,

c3eb8435-c9e4-4094-91ce-f718c334db29-2
00:50:09.435 --> 00:50:13.680
proper policy that it is safe for women
to be in the radiation lab.

5f19a7ea-de62-4253-ad41-6d3790603464-0
00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:17.366
And so as we start to take that
conversation and say, yes,

5f19a7ea-de62-4253-ad41-6d3790603464-1
00:50:17.366 --> 00:50:20.240
but how do we make that even more
protective?

25d23bd2-dbb8-42ea-9415-649235e77bc8-0
00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:22.742
You know,
I think I think there is some

25d23bd2-dbb8-42ea-9415-649235e77bc8-1
00:50:22.742 --> 00:50:27.873
psychological discomfort when you're a
woman stepping into a male dominated feel,

25d23bd2-dbb8-42ea-9415-649235e77bc8-2
00:50:27.873 --> 00:50:31.503
a male dominated space and you have to
declare, you know,

25d23bd2-dbb8-42ea-9415-649235e77bc8-3
00:50:31.503 --> 00:50:35.320
that you would like this extra shielding,
this extra policy.

d46c5649-5bf4-44af-8c5d-786a18bfe010-0
00:50:35.320 --> 00:50:38.280
That alone is, I think,
part of the barrier.

aaf64e33-506b-4109-8286-676268892e10-0
00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:41.574
You know, we have the physical barrier,
but then there is the emotional and the

aaf64e33-506b-4109-8286-676268892e10-1
00:50:41.574 --> 00:50:42.480
psychological barrier.

e9264243-26c9-409c-b303-fa08eb86a83b-0
00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:48.620
And I think it was as my participation as
a trainee and then now as as a graduated

e9264243-26c9-409c-b303-fa08eb86a83b-1
00:50:48.620 --> 00:50:53.800
training to to continue to see those
conversations happening ongoing.

42650c71-2cb2-405f-8e7a-f9f9caf2c4e5-0
00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:56.200
Even just last week on a women's chat.

5399482f-df3f-4266-ac03-d9c8a275391a-0
00:50:56.200 --> 00:51:00.856
I'm a part of a early career training
asked around, you know,

5399482f-df3f-4266-ac03-d9c8a275391a-1
00:51:00.856 --> 00:51:06.189
I would like to get pregnant,
but I'm starting my my Cath lab rotation

5399482f-df3f-4266-ac03-d9c8a275391a-2
00:51:06.189 --> 00:51:10.320
and multitudes of women responded ** year
career here.

0406bf61-330a-46d2-b414-d2252aa3a240-0
00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:13.360
I had X number of babies during X number
of years of training.

df51667b-e108-4e0d-b6fe-f621079191b1-0
00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:17.953
So I think getting the voice out of the
women who have successfully been in the

df51667b-e108-4e0d-b6fe-f621079191b1-1
00:51:17.953 --> 00:51:22.661
lab and been able to raise family and be
an example and a forefront for those who

df51667b-e108-4e0d-b6fe-f621079191b1-2
00:51:22.661 --> 00:51:25.360
are wanting to to to follow that path as
well.

56e63bbe-4f7d-47c4-802b-711bbf563a43-0
00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:32.080
I'd love to hear that positive feedback
from other women in the same position.

e28117ce-8a49-490d-bdf9-01fd4541e595-0
00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:33.320
Absolutely.

b567b32c-9438-4868-b785-3a70ebacff7b-0
00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:37.840
Education is key when women are are
thinking about family planning.

7cc16fc3-39dc-41d8-ba4a-31d1467e9fd2-0
00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:41.640
It's so important to educate yourself
beforehand, right?

71719a66-52cd-40f3-868f-234044de8373-0
00:51:42.040 --> 00:51:44.800
We can, as a physicist,
we can look at your badge readings.

d2a6bea8-c0ed-4736-88ca-67e8a4dcbd34-0
00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:46.964
If you're wearing your decimeter
appropriately,

d2a6bea8-c0ed-4736-88ca-67e8a4dcbd34-1
00:51:46.964 --> 00:51:50.572
we can give you an estimation of what we
would expect to see over the course of

d2a6bea8-c0ed-4736-88ca-67e8a4dcbd34-2
00:51:50.572 --> 00:51:51.520
the next nine months.

96ee5e1a-0acd-4bcc-ad1f-fa149ef38a23-0
00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:56.840
We can also give to educate yourself
right Look at your badge reports.

320c73cc-e1bb-44c0-a69d-4e838c94d3cc-0
00:51:57.040 --> 00:52:00.232
If you're a double badge wearer,
the the badge that you're going to be

320c73cc-e1bb-44c0-a69d-4e838c94d3cc-1
00:52:00.232 --> 00:52:03.920
mostly concerned with is going to be the
one that you're wearing under the lid at

320c73cc-e1bb-44c0-a69d-4e838c94d3cc-2
00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:04.640
the chest level.

d46405c7-f3fb-4f57-83ec-ecef0a7db5d0-0
00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:08.841
That's going to give you the best idea of
what you could expect for a fetal badge

d46405c7-f3fb-4f57-83ec-ecef0a7db5d0-1
00:52:08.841 --> 00:52:09.240
reading.

b1e82253-7b12-48d1-9591-7d8559741fb9-0
00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:13.430
If you're a single badge wearer and
you're wearing your your badge above your

b1e82253-7b12-48d1-9591-7d8559741fb9-1
00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:15.360
lead, you can estimate about 30% of that.

49d2ed3f-8547-4183-9eee-be841818f284-0
00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:16.920
That's going to be your deep dose
equivalent.

66b48f2f-d7cf-4cf4-b468-c8d2c346b58b-0
00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:19.488
So that's,
that's what you want to look at to kind

66b48f2f-d7cf-4cf4-b468-c8d2c346b58b-1
00:52:19.488 --> 00:52:21.000
of see where you're at, right?

0f3fd188-5a62-4458-9962-4c1af13b034a-0
00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:24.015
If,
if you're looking at family planning in

0f3fd188-5a62-4458-9962-4c1af13b034a-1
00:52:24.015 --> 00:52:27.373
the US,
the limit for pregnancy is going to be 5

0f3fd188-5a62-4458-9962-4c1af13b034a-2
00:52:27.373 --> 00:52:31.760
millisieverts or 500 milligram for the
course of the pregnancy.

4960fe76-dc58-41c2-8d84-dd28b7419d14-0
00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:35.360
And, and even furthermore,
we like to see about 50 milligram per

4960fe76-dc58-41c2-8d84-dd28b7419d14-1
00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:36.080
month, right?

b19c10cf-5c71-40b4-beff-7776be9b90d0-0
00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:40.184
And so educate yourself,
look at what your current readings are

b19c10cf-5c71-40b4-beff-7776be9b90d0-1
00:52:40.184 --> 00:52:42.781
and,
and take the steps necessary to start

b19c10cf-5c71-40b4-beff-7776be9b90d0-2
00:52:42.781 --> 00:52:45.740
reducing your dose if you can now,
right before,

b19c10cf-5c71-40b4-beff-7776be9b90d0-3
00:52:45.740 --> 00:52:50.329
before you find yourself pregnant and,
and that emotional and psychological

b19c10cf-5c71-40b4-beff-7776be9b90d0-4
00:52:50.329 --> 00:52:51.959
stress starts to hit right?

b67b8bab-4372-4579-a14f-e498381c5548-0
00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:54.120
Oh no, what,
what can I do now to reduce rate?

4024331b-306d-4f28-873f-fea36138f38b-0
00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:54.680
Do it now.

499d2173-05fa-4709-99c0-a0965103c001-0
00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:57.305
Do it,
Do it before you find yourself in that,

499d2173-05fa-4709-99c0-a0965103c001-1
00:52:57.305 --> 00:53:00.377
in that emotional situation of,
of being pregnant and,

499d2173-05fa-4709-99c0-a0965103c001-2
00:53:00.377 --> 00:53:04.455
and the fear that that may come with that
in, in your, your position in,

499d2173-05fa-4709-99c0-a0965103c001-3
00:53:04.455 --> 00:53:07.360
in the Cath lab in,
in a radioactive fields, right.

1381bccf-d974-4daa-b2b9-942a1a5a7379-0
00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:13.561
I think somebody said,
I'm not going to take credit for it,

1381bccf-d974-4daa-b2b9-942a1a5a7379-1
00:53:13.561 --> 00:53:18.716
but maybe four years ago or so in a
conference in Texas that if each

1381bccf-d974-4daa-b2b9-942a1a5a7379-2
00:53:18.716 --> 00:53:23.720
department catered for a pregnant female
with large breast tissue,

1381bccf-d974-4daa-b2b9-942a1a5a7379-3
00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:27.680
if you catered for that,
you will protect everybody.

d8d4c9f0-ecc3-44e3-8a04-1bdc43ad4484-0
00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:33.130
So if your goals were pregnant female
Millie Sieverts and you catered that for

d8d4c9f0-ecc3-44e3-8a04-1bdc43ad4484-1
00:53:33.130 --> 00:53:35.160
everybody, then everybody wins.

32e4bf15-8f6a-476a-9fc3-bae0eeaa6ace-0
00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:40.480
And I think that that's that was a really
important message that I took home.

3eaf9f6b-88b4-424c-abdb-77f4dc55017f-0
00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:41.360
That's so true.

997ab92e-01ff-4c95-a34a-45136ecfd0ff-0
00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:44.924
If you just treated everybody as a
pregnant female with large breast tissue,

997ab92e-01ff-4c95-a34a-45136ecfd0ff-1
00:53:44.924 --> 00:53:48.626
so you've got to make sure the gowns are
everything fitting, everything's well,

997ab92e-01ff-4c95-a34a-45136ecfd0ff-2
00:53:48.626 --> 00:53:51.080
then you've protected everybody who
you've left out.

ec14d2a3-ed6b-40f1-bb34-851d56b1e87e-0
00:53:52.040 --> 00:53:55.135
And that's, you know,
an aim that I think all of us should

ec14d2a3-ed6b-40f1-bb34-851d56b1e87e-1
00:53:55.135 --> 00:53:56.920
reach because everybody would win.

502fa253-4a7d-464c-9e9b-39db769f5a89-0
00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:59.333
I mean,
it's not exclusive to just a pregnant

502fa253-4a7d-464c-9e9b-39db769f5a89-1
00:53:59.333 --> 00:54:01.160
female also protect male colleagues.

31e1e48e-24e0-4bc1-842c-ad52f9128077-0
00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:03.000
Absolutely.

6ecfb970-0e25-4549-abc8-4977607befb5-0
00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:14.680
So does anybody want to add anything to
any of the juniors right now?

b02a9a19-1c33-4e27-8f40-1dd37d8f7db1-0
00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:16.982
I,
I know I'm focusing mostly on the juniors

b02a9a19-1c33-4e27-8f40-1dd37d8f7db1-1
00:54:16.982 --> 00:54:19.080
because I know there's a lot of concerns.

3fe4d931-7655-4e02-a144-bbd5488ad4c3-0
00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:22.280
Anything motivational,
anything to tell them?

27f4d741-d3c6-4b3e-9840-0db07fb6e07a-0
00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:25.347
I mean,
I always say it's probably the most

27f4d741-d3c6-4b3e-9840-0db07fb6e07a-1
00:54:25.347 --> 00:54:29.957
amazing career interventional,
whether it's radiology, cardiology,

27f4d741-d3c6-4b3e-9840-0db07fb6e07a-2
00:54:29.957 --> 00:54:33.880
anything interventional is the most
amazing career ever.

c289e22c-5f82-4c90-adfd-de3f79d0ab86-0
00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:37.925
And it's, you know,
radiation should never be the thing to

c289e22c-5f82-4c90-adfd-de3f79d0ab86-1
00:54:37.925 --> 00:54:38.360
stop you.

82357985-1582-4095-a2bd-d6b9918c6fa3-0
00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:42.200
But is there anything,
any wisdom that you would like to share?

ef4499da-9a48-4273-bf41-9af87aaca724-0
00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:45.920
I think that's a really important message.

872ae638-bed2-4383-96fb-740db7cb4611-0
00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:49.263
I mean,
there is not a day that I regret coming

872ae638-bed2-4383-96fb-740db7cb4611-1
00:54:49.263 --> 00:54:50.640
into this specialty.

01fad6a1-738c-4270-a61d-e1dfd1429059-0
00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:55.920
You can change the course of a patient's
life in a matter of moments.

0d566e0e-87e7-41b1-932d-fa1d81eb838b-0
00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:58.792
It's,
it's absolutely incredible what we get to

0d566e0e-87e7-41b1-932d-fa1d81eb838b-1
00:54:58.792 --> 00:55:03.639
do with very much a short time of knowing
patients that are super sick sometimes

0d566e0e-87e7-41b1-932d-fa1d81eb838b-2
00:55:03.639 --> 00:55:08.486
when they come rolling into our Cath lab
and we open up a blockage that restores

0d566e0e-87e7-41b1-932d-fa1d81eb838b-3
00:55:08.486 --> 00:55:11.000
blood flow to the majority of their heart.

34f3a773-fb10-41f9-84c1-161d0b0af48e-0
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:16.830
And if anybody tells you not to do it,
make sure that's ultimately your decision

34f3a773-fb10-41f9-84c1-161d0b0af48e-1
00:55:16.830 --> 00:55:18.560
that you don't want to do it.

0e4429ac-7925-4b3a-9a48-a1f36ad94783-0
00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:20.966
Because if there's even a hint that you
want to do it,

0e4429ac-7925-4b3a-9a48-a1f36ad94783-1
00:55:20.966 --> 00:55:23.040
I think you'll forever regret not just
doing it.

f65208bd-1aff-4aa8-8423-747f02a7c3b8-0
00:55:26.600 --> 00:55:27.840
Yeah, I think I definitely echo that.

b868ba9d-64c3-4dd2-8fd5-5eb5ccfe0f8b-0
00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:30.080
Like, I absolutely love my job.

1b6dd4c2-a8a8-498f-b502-62aca71490bd-0
00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:32.760
Can't really imagine doing anything else.

02b84a52-6af4-4f95-a539-45c3060b46c4-0
00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:34.560
And is it hard?

4f100279-6ba5-4b20-ad8a-dc845ad21fb7-0
00:55:35.120 --> 00:55:36.840
Yeah, But that's OK.

ecdb45aa-5e1f-4d04-8c2f-d99c63ab41e4-0
00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:38.240
We can do hard things.

d973ca63-19fd-421c-a24f-afd459e9d125-0
00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:39.960
And.

93c0f2e0-2cfb-49f3-840a-2e7690b9146b-0
00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:41.840
But it's incredibly worthwhile.

beef0751-fde7-4742-bcae-563405733afd-0
00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:46.188
And I don't think there is anything in
life that's worthwhile,

beef0751-fde7-4742-bcae-563405733afd-1
00:55:46.188 --> 00:55:48.000
that is easy and that's OK.

2176b7f9-4d38-42c2-9412-ae9341f7d6d3-0
00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:55.525
I'd like just to add that, you know,
for not just our female or and male

2176b7f9-4d38-42c2-9412-ae9341f7d6d3-1
00:55:55.525 --> 00:55:58.142
juniors,
but what Doctor Davies is saying is

2176b7f9-4d38-42c2-9412-ae9341f7d6d3-2
00:55:58.142 --> 00:56:00.120
having a little bit of thick skin.

7f3fe28f-0db7-46c1-8bc4-9a593d5c3c41-0
00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:04.858
I think when you step into the space and
you show that you are kind and caring and

7f3fe28f-0db7-46c1-8bc4-9a593d5c3c41-1
00:56:04.858 --> 00:56:07.942
you care about your patients and you want
to do good work,

7f3fe28f-0db7-46c1-8bc4-9a593d5c3c41-2
00:56:07.942 --> 00:56:11.810
you will get the support from the staff,
from the techs, from the nurses,

7f3fe28f-0db7-46c1-8bc4-9a593d5c3c41-3
00:56:11.810 --> 00:56:14.320
from your both your female and male
colleagues.

cda5f948-1ef2-41b7-9e9a-15f26a8879ed-0
00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:18.059
So I think first and foremost,
stay positive about your journey into

cda5f948-1ef2-41b7-9e9a-15f26a8879ed-1
00:56:18.059 --> 00:56:21.040
this career and secondly about having
that thick skin.

468f20ee-78d2-473c-bfef-39e97ee8a340-0
00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:23.720
It doesn't necessarily mean being tough
and rigid.

d3704ff0-79d7-4ea9-b485-b1a1f1fd2ad9-0
00:56:23.720 --> 00:56:25.280
It's simply just speaking up.

2dad2fb8-dd49-49fe-83af-f2bba5a8ab7e-0
00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:29.961
I think when you you take the time and
columnate or you take the time and you

2dad2fb8-dd49-49fe-83af-f2bba5a8ab7e-1
00:56:29.961 --> 00:56:32.640
ask for all the Shields,
all the protection,

2dad2fb8-dd49-49fe-83af-f2bba5a8ab7e-2
00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:36.984
you take the time to explain to your
staff, it's not just protecting me,

2dad2fb8-dd49-49fe-83af-f2bba5a8ab7e-3
00:56:36.984 --> 00:56:39.960
it's protecting you,
it's protecting the patient.

ffec336e-df24-4bdb-9d4c-8173d7e5cb2d-0
00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:43.909
And when I think you keep it focused with
positivity, patient care,

ffec336e-df24-4bdb-9d4c-8173d7e5cb2d-1
00:56:43.909 --> 00:56:46.607
and also staff centered and not just me
centered,

ffec336e-df24-4bdb-9d4c-8173d7e5cb2d-2
00:56:46.607 --> 00:56:50.600
I think the support that you find around
yourself will be insurmountable.

5a4ae944-cdaf-4f91-ba22-cbae666be6b0-0
00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:54.227
And I think it just motivates you to
continue your trajectory in your career

5a4ae944-cdaf-4f91-ba22-cbae666be6b0-1
00:56:54.227 --> 00:56:54.600
as well.

488a256b-21d6-420c-a395-5632afa5043a-0
00:56:54.600 --> 00:56:56.680
So take the time to speak up.

7ba0ffca-acfd-4092-aab5-ddc6d72af06d-0
00:56:56.720 --> 00:57:00.560
You know, sometimes my male colleagues,
as I was cathering with them were a lot

7ba0ffca-acfd-4092-aab5-ddc6d72af06d-1
00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:01.280
taller than me.

f549e31d-6f9b-4e0d-8f0a-eda70c0c0364-0
00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:04.480
And I would ask them, you know,
can we compromise on this table height?

97b2cc47-e08c-4c2b-81e3-d20fe017229c-0
00:57:04.480 --> 00:57:07.969
And they were more than happy to when you
let the the staff know that, hey,

97b2cc47-e08c-4c2b-81e3-d20fe017229c-1
00:57:07.969 --> 00:57:09.760
may I have the shield put on the table?

0de4f0de-1c5e-4a89-b1a6-f02de96a63cf-0
00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:11.720
May I have this rag pad put on this table?

086f2b35-9273-4232-94cf-91b8d13dcd46-0
00:57:11.960 --> 00:57:15.160
May I have this radiation protection
device put on the table?

feb65d4e-7c91-445b-9b29-d2293186f6aa-0
00:57:15.480 --> 00:57:19.695
They are happy to do it once you explain
that it's a benefit for everyone in the

feb65d4e-7c91-445b-9b29-d2293186f6aa-1
00:57:19.695 --> 00:57:20.840
room, patients, staff.

e0876944-16c1-4d3c-8ed0-6ef8afab7383-0
00:57:29.720 --> 00:57:30.240
Thank you.

3f6d94eb-4b60-4ef9-9055-ad5561ae9c2c-0
00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:33.840
If that is all,
is there anything you want to add?

f1c39b3b-a2cb-4b4a-a739-8b6c8fa8a2a1-0
00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:37.240
Doctor Foster, are we happy to wrap up?

c5b4e5a5-e5f8-48fc-9ea3-a728bdb41e6a-0
00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:38.240
Is there anything else?

b224b7dd-8b55-459b-bab6-ede16d4ad1a0-0
00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:39.320
Yeah, no, that's great.

8750320e-6b81-4b43-b730-2d493c1aee38-0
00:57:39.320 --> 00:57:40.600
So that really ends in.

0aa20da3-fd04-4cf6-9f9d-c9419ea88eac-0
00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:41.160
Thank you.

63781173-9e27-438a-9ad5-b1a5cd814fe3-0
00:57:41.320 --> 00:57:41.680
Thank you.

d8c364e6-9906-4c37-bdb6-f5747428b97d-0
00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:43.760
All that was that was really fantastic.

140af565-f79a-4333-813f-1e116ee321eb-0
00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:46.052
And and I think, you know,
as we look to the future,

140af565-f79a-4333-813f-1e116ee321eb-1
00:57:46.052 --> 00:57:49.080
I think we're going to be able to begin
to see some of those changes.

bf1b68eb-d304-4934-8d4c-84e7a9dcaf49-0
00:57:49.080 --> 00:57:49.720
At least I hope.

f8ca1735-e033-4bb7-96df-f366e2a70d5c-0
00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:51.760
I hope that it happens now.

345a1626-cbe9-4124-a15a-b6dfa533bfb3-0
00:57:51.760 --> 00:57:55.912
I hope it happens quickly and with I
think the momentum that we have of really

345a1626-cbe9-4124-a15a-b6dfa533bfb3-1
00:57:55.912 --> 00:57:59.591
just awareness that that it,
it can be a safe place and understanding

345a1626-cbe9-4124-a15a-b6dfa533bfb3-2
00:57:59.591 --> 00:58:02.377
radiation,
I think we're going to go a long way with

345a1626-cbe9-4124-a15a-b6dfa533bfb3-3
00:58:02.377 --> 00:58:02.640
that.

e76c9121-70d2-4410-83c9-6cdb7d91a39e-0
00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:05.880
So the next session is a roundtable
discussion.

b76ff519-1e2a-4ffe-91b3-1bf35c016fef-0
00:58:05.880 --> 00:58:06.400
We're going to close.

a8889789-1d13-4fd4-b3d2-15fde1a749f3-0
00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:10.813
We've got some really wonderful people to
talk about how do we make that change and

a8889789-1d13-4fd4-b3d2-15fde1a749f3-1
00:58:10.813 --> 00:58:12.600
who's responsible for that change.

e9284ce6-1761-4bfc-85c7-ab84548b923c-0
00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:16.040
And so we're going to really dive into
that in about 10 minutes.

5e2706bd-8d7d-4e5e-ac05-6aaad0c60768-0
00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:18.240
So so hope to see you all then.

Thank you all.

Thank you.

Thank you.
