00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.448
Hello,
thank you very much for inviting me to

5268215e-2953-44f5-8144-7214adb148b9-1
00:00:03.448 --> 00:00:08.947
speak on this topic about how radiation
actually affects your genetic code,

5268215e-2953-44f5-8144-7214adb148b9-2
00:00:08.947 --> 00:00:11.480
your nuclear and mitochondrial DNA.

49d32dab-e14e-4a35-9887-519385886da3-0
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.389
Most people talk about lead,
they talk about barriers,

49d32dab-e14e-4a35-9887-519385886da3-1
00:00:16.389 --> 00:00:22.454
they talk about the inverse square law,
but there's very little data on the

49d32dab-e14e-4a35-9887-519385886da3-2
00:00:22.454 --> 00:00:28.200
actual permanent damage or mechanism of
action of radiation on our DNA.

503b6c22-3459-455c-bdcd-457452042622-0
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:36.024
So that's what I've studied for the last
14 years and I have conflicts to get this

503b6c22-3459-455c-bdcd-457452042622-1
00:00:36.024 --> 00:00:36.880
work done.

95e5521e-c1ae-49f9-9b4f-35551bd5f184-0
00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:42.215
We started a company through our hospital
tech transfer office and I'm the founder

95e5521e-c1ae-49f9-9b4f-35551bd5f184-1
00:00:42.215 --> 00:00:44.080
and inventor of that company.

18228d7c-405f-43c1-a8dc-c386519c9f4a-0
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.560
I will monitor myself to make sure I
don't have a conflict of interest.

aabe04fb-ac83-442e-9ac9-30713555f30f-0
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:57.640
We do have FDA and Health Canada approval
for this thing that I invented.

490e2a7e-8ede-4927-b46b-5f2cbd98aa90-0
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.736
Our learning objective is to discuss what
happens to proteins and DNA at the

490e2a7e-8ede-4927-b46b-5f2cbd98aa90-1
00:01:03.736 --> 00:01:08.186
molecular level when exposed to radiation,
discuss the mechanism of action and

490e2a7e-8ede-4927-b46b-5f2cbd98aa90-2
00:01:08.186 --> 00:01:11.960
discuss strategies for protecting your
DNA from long term effects.

95ecd162-aaeb-4028-9460-a50fb98495fa-0
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.313
And I would add making it more aware that
we're not all equally vulnerable to

95ecd162-aaeb-4028-9460-a50fb98495fa-1
00:01:17.313 --> 00:01:18.480
radiation, right.

1131fca0-3c65-4b31-931f-14ec141eff55-0
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.446
I mean,
some of us with with particular genetic

1131fca0-3c65-4b31-931f-14ec141eff55-1
00:01:22.446 --> 00:01:28.480
inherited traits have greater risk of
injury than others from radiation.

b3eb36ae-00bb-471c-874d-d228bf7dd463-0
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.038
OK,
so I'm specifically going to talk about

b3eb36ae-00bb-471c-874d-d228bf7dd463-1
00:01:32.038 --> 00:01:35.760
using antioxidants to prevent DNA damage
from X-ray radiation.

44eb860f-25e3-427b-94c5-d2fd703aa71a-0
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:43.593
And there's a bunch of papers by us and
by other people showing that this simple

44eb860f-25e3-427b-94c5-d2fd703aa71a-1
00:01:43.593 --> 00:01:51.232
innocuous vitamin strategy has been shown
to markedly decrease DNA damage from

44eb860f-25e3-427b-94c5-d2fd703aa71a-2
00:01:51.232 --> 00:01:52.200
radiation.

1a9340ee-fb72-496a-a328-3810fbc28041-0
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:58.040
We all know the volumes are enormous,
about 80 million CTS a year,

1a9340ee-fb72-496a-a328-3810fbc28041-1
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.341
5 billion dental X-rays a year globally
from dentists,

1a9340ee-fb72-496a-a328-3810fbc28041-2
00:02:02.341 --> 00:02:06.800
the largest contributor of radiation to
children by far.

88120509-1e6e-42c7-a612-5a36db5c081f-0
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.240
Most radiation is lactive, some acute,
but 7030.

689e193a-4f49-4c6a-abad-1a76c81f5fa9-0
00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.706
The younger you are when you get the
radiation,

689e193a-4f49-4c6a-abad-1a76c81f5fa9-1
00:02:16.706 --> 00:02:22.908
the longer the kind of incubation period
and the longer and the the opportunity to

689e193a-4f49-4c6a-abad-1a76c81f5fa9-2
00:02:22.908 --> 00:02:23.880
grow a tumor.

9b7a3e1b-0af3-4d02-b3c3-62569249595d-0
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:29.582
And then of course we see this in say
kids in pediatric hospitals having renal

9b7a3e1b-0af3-4d02-b3c3-62569249595d-1
00:02:29.582 --> 00:02:33.624
flow studies with nuclear medicine agents
or scoliosis,

9b7a3e1b-0af3-4d02-b3c3-62569249595d-2
00:02:33.624 --> 00:02:39.038
children having repeated whole spine
studies getting sarcomas or kids with

9b7a3e1b-0af3-4d02-b3c3-62569249595d-3
00:02:39.038 --> 00:02:42.720
hydrocephalus getting, you know,
10s of head CT's.

1ba1a206-78bc-4f93-b0cb-ea8f7cce3444-0
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.200
And they have secondary oncology side
effects.

b36ff0b6-a9ae-4238-82ec-8c2e23068b32-0
00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.840
If you have ACT on its own,
you get DNA breaks.

71792725-0c01-4983-b486-36d04f2dac0c-0
00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.459
And we measure this by looking at gamma
H2 XA marker of DNA damage in peripheral

71792725-0c01-4983-b486-36d04f2dac0c-1
00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.680
mononuclear cells in your blood.

3c697fd9-c92a-4034-ac2b-d1397a28afaf-0
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.960
And we draw the blood and we measure
those gamma H2X breaks.

6788f057-3098-4518-a17f-f03f00e33f28-0
00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.800
If you have X-ray dye and CT,
you have even more breaks.

76ecaeea-8623-4224-a6ef-8060b76f3cf2-0
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.120
It's concatenation of effects.

2c7f6541-88bf-49ea-b3ab-47e95c77858c-0
00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.984
Contrast enhanced CT increases the number
of double stranded DNA breaks over CT

2c7f6541-88bf-49ea-b3ab-47e95c77858c-1
00:03:14.984 --> 00:03:15.400
alone.

827716fd-7176-45b4-b286-3fc3406fef3d-0
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.387
Now if you have a radio iodine injection
for thyroid cancer,

827716fd-7176-45b4-b286-3fc3406fef3d-1
00:03:20.387 --> 00:03:23.840
then there's considerably increased DNA
damage.

18a594f2-ed45-41ab-87a3-fb894e30a2c2-0
00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.659
Of course,
if you have chemotherapy and X-ray or

18a594f2-ed45-41ab-87a3-fb894e30a2c2-1
00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:32.571
chemotherapy and X-ray and CT, you,
you have even more breaks,

18a594f2-ed45-41ab-87a3-fb894e30a2c2-2
00:03:32.571 --> 00:03:34.520
increased susceptibility.

08ef4021-4179-46c0-ae9b-1f95bdec1326-0
00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.598
And now we do procedures with doses over
five grade to a patient with

08ef4021-4179-46c0-ae9b-1f95bdec1326-1
00:03:39.598 --> 00:03:43.171
electrophysiology,
with long coronary interventions,

08ef4021-4179-46c0-ae9b-1f95bdec1326-2
00:03:43.171 --> 00:03:47.351
with TAVI, with EVAR,
with AVM embolizations in the brains or

08ef4021-4179-46c0-ae9b-1f95bdec1326-3
00:03:47.351 --> 00:03:48.160
AV fistulas.

21696d06-c2fe-4366-b5d7-dfe725a3c198-0
00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:54.170
And it's not uncommon for patients to get
up to even 7 grey or a rarely 10 grey of

21696d06-c2fe-4366-b5d7-dfe725a3c198-1
00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:59.240
radiation from one procedure or a staged
set of procedures over time.

6e237cd2-b049-4ef7-96ec-4ab14914ff06-0
00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.720
And those are therapeutic doses.

76e8e195-76d8-49be-8333-0caa9eed3bfa-0
00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:07.083
We know from cardiology literature
published by the CMAJ that every 10 milli

76e8e195-76d8-49be-8333-0caa9eed3bfa-1
00:04:07.083 --> 00:04:12.053
sieverts of low dose ionizing radiation
has a 3% increase in the risk of age and

76e8e195-76d8-49be-8333-0caa9eed3bfa-2
00:04:12.053 --> 00:04:13.280
sex adjusted cancer.

0be73596-ba22-456d-827e-33cdcca711bf-0
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.000
Every 10 milli sieverts has a 3% increase
in risk.

5793c4e1-40cf-42dd-aca7-28e739d5ab86-0
00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:26.077
I looked at other things and found that
MRI is associated with DNA damage from a

5793c4e1-40cf-42dd-aca7-28e739d5ab86-1
00:04:26.077 --> 00:04:27.440
different mechanism.

d014c347-8d69-47bd-a68b-cbe805419477-0
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.768
But there are three or four papers
showing that MRI is not innocuous,

d014c347-8d69-47bd-a68b-cbe805419477-1
00:04:31.768 --> 00:04:35.640
and this just indicates that humans are
vulnerable to radiation.

a4b3338b-e030-411c-a563-2762e3a4b417-0
00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.292
Low dose radiation that we're exposed to
occupationally is generally overlooked by

a4b3338b-e030-411c-a563-2762e3a4b417-1
00:04:42.292 --> 00:04:44.120
comparison to patient exposure.

f0d43d5d-60af-4ba7-91d1-a5e56787b3f6-0
00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.618
And our chronic low dose radiation
exposure occupationally is kind of Pooh

f0d43d5d-60af-4ba7-91d1-a5e56787b3f6-1
00:04:48.618 --> 00:04:49.880
poohed by many people.

d82570a6-772b-49d4-9c20-9eb2bf67e5f2-0
00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.560
But it does cause a chronic inflammatory
state.

9b11ee03-64e7-437f-b3eb-f9e075e421c5-0
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.880
The IAEA pays very little attention to it.

f502bc8d-5994-4d0d-bbd8-e2bb8586846c-0
00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.929
Not all of us wear our badges,
but in our lifetime,

f502bc8d-5994-4d0d-bbd8-e2bb8586846c-1
00:04:58.929 --> 00:05:01.360
some of us will get doses of around 1
grain.

5c0316ee-f64f-484c-9062-a8e06f85b7b9-0
00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.240
We know that the founders of radiology
did badly.

f026b3bc-f9d8-4d44-8701-d36ad164da68-0
00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.240
They lost fingers, they developed cancers,
they died.

b8ea4ec7-a44a-4cca-bf77-f328838807b4-0
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:17.039
And we know that some of our colleagues
are similarly today experiencing the side

b8ea4ec7-a44a-4cca-bf77-f328838807b4-1
00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:20.200
effects of radiation exposure from their
occupations.

43efd963-eb2c-4a14-81bf-aa87b26056a4-0
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.254
And then the work,
hence the work that Bob Foster etcetera

43efd963-eb2c-4a14-81bf-aa87b26056a4-1
00:05:23.254 --> 00:05:25.222
is doing,
there is a great picture of

43efd963-eb2c-4a14-81bf-aa87b26056a4-2
00:05:25.222 --> 00:05:29.467
interventionalists looking at their legs
and seeing that they have no hair on the

43efd963-eb2c-4a14-81bf-aa87b26056a4-3
00:05:29.467 --> 00:05:33.040
outside of the left side of the leg
because the X-ray tube is there.

3c330fe8-040e-405d-b919-d86d8403abae-0
00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.887
We put DLDS on people's heads and arms
and necks etcetera and found that the

3c330fe8-040e-405d-b919-d86d8403abae-1
00:05:38.887 --> 00:05:43.903
left side of the head got 6 times more
radiation than the right side of the head

3c330fe8-040e-405d-b919-d86d8403abae-2
00:05:43.903 --> 00:05:45.080
in the Anjou sleep.

4f0187e9-d4bc-411b-80c9-6223c922f0f4-0
00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.454
I wrote a very boring paper on
cataractogenesis,

4f0187e9-d4bc-411b-80c9-6223c922f0f4-1
00:05:49.454 --> 00:05:54.356
looking in radiation exposure over time,
looking at the place in the lens that the

4f0187e9-d4bc-411b-80c9-6223c922f0f4-2
00:05:54.356 --> 00:05:57.132
cataract develops,
it's the posterior chamber,

4f0187e9-d4bc-411b-80c9-6223c922f0f4-3
00:05:57.132 --> 00:05:59.908
not the anterior middle that it's
age-related,

4f0187e9-d4bc-411b-80c9-6223c922f0f4-4
00:05:59.908 --> 00:06:02.566
but the posterior aspect of the cataract
of,

4f0187e9-d4bc-411b-80c9-6223c922f0f4-5
00:06:02.566 --> 00:06:06.760
of the of the lens is where the cataract
develops when it's radiation.

a0036946-a7bd-4745-ab94-c97daa00a4bd-0
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.200
And there is a genetic susceptibility to
this.

742f7bdf-4a16-4183-a75e-e4b0fcd1897c-0
00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:14.971
And this is I think the Canary in the
coal mine for a greater concern of of

742f7bdf-4a16-4183-a75e-e4b0fcd1897c-1
00:06:14.971 --> 00:06:16.040
body radiation.

89cbf059-5f9d-4004-807a-51b78e45a407-0
00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:21.117
And we know that 38% of interventional
cardiologists get posterior lens

89cbf059-5f9d-4004-807a-51b78e45a407-1
00:06:21.117 --> 00:06:22.400
opacities and carrots.

7f89d0ae-9f4e-4752-b2e4-b491658be8ae-0
00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.803
We also know that in 2011,
the dose to the eye that was allowable

7f89d0ae-9f4e-4752-b2e4-b491658be8ae-1
00:06:27.803 --> 00:06:30.680
was reduced to 1/7 of the previous
allowable dose.

26d5cf7a-63ec-4a85-beb3-cba8bb0e96bc-0
00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.961
There are papers of 80 of 31 cases of
interventional cardiologists with left

26d5cf7a-63ec-4a85-beb3-cba8bb0e96bc-1
00:06:35.961 --> 00:06:39.440
sided brain tumors and you'll have heard
this from other people.

41384622-9222-47a7-8f12-32676ad4bd3c-0
00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:47.819
I was concerned about the fact that we
don't get screened prior to choosing our

41384622-9222-47a7-8f12-32676ad4bd3c-1
00:06:47.819 --> 00:06:54.158
career for risks of impaired repair from
radiation injury and I published this

41384622-9222-47a7-8f12-32676ad4bd3c-2
00:06:54.158 --> 00:06:54.639
paper.

f53a2740-f1b2-4187-bcda-85c6face427e-0
00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:56.680
It was very difficult to publish.

79574761-ae2d-4472-a02c-31338cfe9bbe-0
00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.520
I got a lot of pushback on this.

33e9f4d3-4c36-4054-b782-4fb0149a38cf-0
00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:03.762
But then my friend Bija Modari in London
looked at DNA damage and his colleagues

33e9f4d3-4c36-4054-b782-4fb0149a38cf-1
00:07:03.762 --> 00:07:08.066
doing EVAR and found there was
significant individual variation and DNA

33e9f4d3-4c36-4054-b782-4fb0149a38cf-2
00:07:08.066 --> 00:07:11.055
damage amongst individuals who got the
same dose,

33e9f4d3-4c36-4054-b782-4fb0149a38cf-3
00:07:11.055 --> 00:07:15.240
proving in fact that not all of us are
equally able to repair damage.

6ca2dbde-8f75-4934-bfca-c31149c094b3-0
00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:23.235
There's a lot of data from DNIH looking
at radiation damage in X-ray

6ca2dbde-8f75-4934-bfca-c31149c094b3-1
00:07:23.235 --> 00:07:29.075
technologists who have delivered a
nuclear medicine materials showing

6ca2dbde-8f75-4934-bfca-c31149c094b3-2
00:07:29.075 --> 00:07:35.832
increased risk of squamous cell cancer,
all 'cause mortality, breast cancer, MI,

6ca2dbde-8f75-4934-bfca-c31149c094b3-3
00:07:35.832 --> 00:07:39.919
etcetera,
all from this reactive oxygen species.

051e8644-39c1-4224-9d80-0e0ad58a1ff1-0
00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:47.134
And in fact there's work on cancer risk
and radiation technologists overall from

051e8644-39c1-4224-9d80-0e0ad58a1ff1-1
00:07:47.134 --> 00:07:51.840
many different sites trying up to 5.
7 fold increase of thyroid cancer.

70f8d1ad-6b13-40d8-9526-c9344b2ab8fe-0
00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:59.701
There's a whole stream of papers looking
at specific mutations and polymorphisms

70f8d1ad-6b13-40d8-9526-c9344b2ab8fe-1
00:07:59.701 --> 00:08:04.585
and Snips etcetera,
copy number variations in medical workers

70f8d1ad-6b13-40d8-9526-c9344b2ab8fe-2
00:08:04.585 --> 00:08:10.493
exposed to radiation and cardiologists
and meta analysis of these data in,

70f8d1ad-6b13-40d8-9526-c9344b2ab8fe-3
00:08:10.493 --> 00:08:14.669
in radiation workers in nuclear medicine
facilities,

70f8d1ad-6b13-40d8-9526-c9344b2ab8fe-4
00:08:14.669 --> 00:08:21.129
in nuclear power facilities showing that
specific types of aberrations of DNA are

70f8d1ad-6b13-40d8-9526-c9344b2ab8fe-5
00:08:21.129 --> 00:08:26.880
associated with greater numbers of poor
outcomes and cancers, et cetera.

0ede1398-5cea-42d0-adcc-7ecffd4155c9-0
00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.440
And we don't look at this right.

70a458ba-4b2b-4daa-ada7-845ddec4e1d7-0
00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:31.000
We, we don't think about this at all.

093fc25b-ee00-45f5-ac50-09d2caaddf56-0
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.120
We all think we're equal.

909db323-229b-45fb-8ec0-fa9a39a22201-0
00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:36.400
Somehow we've become inure to the fact
that we're, we're, we're different now.

9ddddc8f-62b0-4644-9b85-f5129df823f9-0
00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:38.920
We rely on lead to protect us.

0b24ae7c-f57d-4ab7-bddf-4dfbac04f0c1-0
00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:42.560
And one of the most fun,
cheapest projects I've ever done.

66743926-7a73-4442-ae7b-b1668660af61-0
00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:46.300
Well,
I spent 340 bucks buying lead testing

66743926-7a73-4442-ae7b-b1668660af61-1
00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:47.480
kits on Amazon.

49db67a6-0198-4f79-bcdc-82d62748bf2d-0
00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:52.506
And my students and I checked the lead
aprons that we use in our radiology

49db67a6-0198-4f79-bcdc-82d62748bf2d-1
00:08:52.506 --> 00:08:55.408
departments in three centers in our
system,

49db67a6-0198-4f79-bcdc-82d62748bf2d-2
00:08:55.408 --> 00:09:00.354
and we found that 61% of the hospital
lead aprons at the University Health

49db67a6-0198-4f79-bcdc-82d62748bf2d-3
00:09:00.354 --> 00:09:03.520
Network have free lead powder on their
surface.

cf307dc4-fed8-4bf0-8acd-580c1bef8863-0
00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:06.280
There is no safe level of lead.

10a4667f-c2ef-43ec-9a2c-faff917f49d1-0
00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:12.017
And other folks have measured lead levels
in the hair of X-ray technologists and

10a4667f-c2ef-43ec-9a2c-faff917f49d1-1
00:09:12.017 --> 00:09:13.800
found that they are elevated.

0b151f46-71ec-42a7-8ca3-eddb35222265-0
00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:16.681
In other words,
it's been ingested from fingertips and

0b151f46-71ec-42a7-8ca3-eddb35222265-1
00:09:16.681 --> 00:09:17.520
food and eating.

8c42f02b-9dba-4f56-821f-ac8753d54731-0
00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.100
So we're trying to protect ourselves with
lead,

8c42f02b-9dba-4f56-821f-ac8753d54731-1
00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:21.920
but we're also getting lead into our
system.

3be2d276-af29-437f-ac2b-95ea779870ee-0
00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:25.400
So we need to find another method of
providing protection.

efe61b66-26a9-45dc-be68-40830ccd54bd-0
00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:30.421
So what happened was I came home from
work bothered by all this and my

efe61b66-26a9-45dc-be68-40830ccd54bd-1
00:09:30.421 --> 00:09:35.251
wonderful mother-in-law had just been
diagnosed with breast cancer and she was

efe61b66-26a9-45dc-be68-40830ccd54bd-2
00:09:35.251 --> 00:09:38.675
told, you know,
we're going to give you radiation chemo

efe61b66-26a9-45dc-be68-40830ccd54bd-3
00:09:38.675 --> 00:09:39.960
before the radiation.

f781c0a0-61ab-4323-9f57-c5c1d7e014ca-0
00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.680
Do not take these things.

9a678882-0079-4697-8a68-460d6e196643-0
00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:46.360
And she showed me the list for advice and
they were all antioxidants.

d267c644-6646-45f9-b868-17d3d83461c4-0
00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:50.395
And I thought heck,
if antioxidants can block the effect of

d267c644-6646-45f9-b868-17d3d83461c4-1
00:09:50.395 --> 00:09:55.844
grey of radiation from therapeutic doses,
surely it will block milli sieverts of

d267c644-6646-45f9-b868-17d3d83461c4-2
00:09:55.844 --> 00:10:00.687
radiation from from low dose radiation
occupationally or from a CT or a

d267c644-6646-45f9-b868-17d3d83461c4-3
00:10:00.687 --> 00:10:01.359
mammogram.

a2a42098-ba43-425c-be7e-001cfbde107c-0
00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:03.440
And that initiated this research.

122f3de5-f690-4950-b8f2-42c667ca46a5-0
00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:09.663
And basically the mechanism of action is
that radiation will hit a water molecule,

122f3de5-f690-4950-b8f2-42c667ca46a5-1
00:10:09.663 --> 00:10:13.862
the water molecule will split,
producing free radicals,

122f3de5-f690-4950-b8f2-42c667ca46a5-2
00:10:13.862 --> 00:10:19.786
and those free radicals will bind to
strands of DNA and this will result in an

122f3de5-f690-4950-b8f2-42c667ca46a5-3
00:10:19.786 --> 00:10:25.860
oxidative injury because oxygen binds to
those free radicals at that site in the

122f3de5-f690-4950-b8f2-42c667ca46a5-4
00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:26.160
DNA.

5070464c-ac1c-481d-add5-5efcbe246639-0
00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:33.065
So if you give an antioxidant,
you decrease the presence of these free

5070464c-ac1c-481d-add5-5efcbe246639-1
00:10:33.065 --> 00:10:33.880
radicals.

94ef6ce4-e4b4-4681-9485-e7b8b6ec461a-0
00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:36.720
And that's the mechanism of action of
this.

ebd5caf3-4fd3-4a58-9d21-f24b48c66b3c-0
00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:37.800
How do you measure that?

d11c323d-b13f-417c-b4b2-e487c5acb19f-0
00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:40.484
Well,
there are two principal methods in

d11c323d-b13f-417c-b4b2-e487c5acb19f-1
00:10:40.484 --> 00:10:41.200
nuclear DNA.

62d89d26-3654-46e2-a55a-1ad8e7e55210-0
00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:45.680
You look at gamma H2X and P53-P53 is
called the guardian of the genome.

0d6bf4b4-ba97-4b06-b7af-2240fd1983f4-0
00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:46.560
The guardian of the genome.

1c3222d7-b458-4963-88e9-37348de02957-0
00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.400
So I had this in my head.

2e1d1a75-ca63-4e39-9129-737ca18ddc93-0
00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:55.739
My son, who was little at the time,
and our dog Cora went for a walk,

2e1d1a75-ca63-4e39-9129-737ca18ddc93-1
00:10:55.739 --> 00:10:57.680
bumped into another dog.

f069feb7-afb3-4804-a72b-3e348e3ed48e-0
00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.960
I was thinking about antioxidants.

c8a2148c-9077-4eb2-8cc4-bdd3412738be-0
00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:05.240
The owner of the other dog that we met
turned out to make antioxidants.

7c2c47b8-3b68-4fbd-a9f5-0cc36ac1d724-0
00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:07.080
He asked me what I was bothered by.

6b5ed081-4644-4e8f-8bd3-8d7f3770e7e3-0
00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:09.040
I told him so I make antioxidants.

b714a5f3-a059-456f-b35f-7f8330d033f2-0
00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:14.427
So we used his antioxidants in ourselves
and did experiments on ourselves to try

b714a5f3-a059-456f-b35f-7f8330d033f2-1
00:11:14.427 --> 00:11:18.520
and make a cocktail that would decrease
DNA damage from radiation.

aab9e6b5-7dc4-49b5-99ee-03c5721b9bec-0
00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:24.458
So we drew our blood,
radiated it in a cellar radiator and then

aab9e6b5-7dc4-49b5-99ee-03c5721b9bec-1
00:11:24.458 --> 00:11:27.520
measured breaks with H2X and P53.

1b36bebf-5bc3-4ea1-928c-bcf8fdd2aad1-0
00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:32.213
And then we took the formulation that we
had and saw that the number of breaks

1b36bebf-5bc3-4ea1-928c-bcf8fdd2aad1-1
00:11:32.213 --> 00:11:35.560
decreased with premedication and we
mucked around with that.

16407544-80da-4c22-b0ec-0323cf99be7e-0
00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:39.936
And then we did a clinical trial with
this formulation of beta carotene, NAC,

16407544-80da-4c22-b0ec-0323cf99be7e-1
00:11:39.936 --> 00:11:44.088
vitamin question, alpha lipoic acid,
funded by our cardiology department,

16407544-80da-4c22-b0ec-0323cf99be7e-2
00:11:44.088 --> 00:11:46.781
the Peterman Cardiac Center,
who gave us A $40,

16407544-80da-4c22-b0ec-0323cf99be7e-3
00:11:46.781 --> 00:11:48.240
000 grant to do this work.

610de458-164c-4e51-9697-e208768b0837-0
00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:53.990
They published this paper in 2017 and
basically were able to show that in 10

610de458-164c-4e51-9697-e208768b0837-1
00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:56.280
patients, 5 premedicated, 5 not.

1fe4cd74-1feb-46ec-9fba-301efeb8e423-0
00:11:56.680 --> 00:12:01.240
If they were not premedicated after a
bone scan, their breaks at least doubled.

ffa6443f-62d2-4d37-9159-9ae0f3b3c745-0
00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:06.270
And if they were premedicated,
there was statistically no change in the

ffa6443f-62d2-4d37-9159-9ae0f3b3c745-1
00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:08.040
number of breaks that they had.

74b5ae19-67eb-4e48-b317-1dee2d047084-0
00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:09.840
So brilliant outcome.

4d323d6e-bf2d-4bb7-a222-cbee3a98797d-0
00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:12.120
And that started this work.

15beb845-5b7d-445c-9e3e-9c017e1fcfff-0
00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:15.880
That work has been reproduced by other
people, published in Radiology.

abe129e0-4255-4dad-ad72-96e834749eda-0
00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:21.393
I made a better formulation trying to
protect the nucleus with the help of a

abe129e0-4255-4dad-ad72-96e834749eda-1
00:12:21.393 --> 00:12:26.640
mitochondrial expert neurologist who
treats inherited mitochondrial disorders,

abe129e0-4255-4dad-ad72-96e834749eda-2
00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:30.160
Mark Turnipolski McMaster,
a professor of neurology.

29f36977-d6a0-48dd-bd7f-37c77272fe1a-0
00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:30.520
There.

021d86be-2207-4b81-8787-d445f42b4bc8-0
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.690
We added some key other elements,
and then we tried to expand the duration

021d86be-2207-4b81-8787-d445f42b4bc8-1
00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:39.880
of this in our system to 12 minutes to 12
hours, so 2 pills a day.

03480bab-1b9b-478b-a86b-3bce1f9c77ee-0
00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:44.442
I did a bunch of experiments on myself
again looking at different doses and

03480bab-1b9b-478b-a86b-3bce1f9c77ee-1
00:12:44.442 --> 00:12:45.400
different regimes.

a5a6bdb9-f0ad-4392-95f4-d9ede7bf88db-0
00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:52.866
Blue is radiation of my blood without pre
medication and orange is is is is

a5a6bdb9-f0ad-4392-95f4-d9ede7bf88db-1
00:12:52.866 --> 00:12:56.400
damaging my blood with pre medication.

e043e16d-9937-46d9-b046-a93ce6a29331-0
00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:58.800
And this went on for a while to we
perfected the doses.

5f88cbf6-65a2-45c7-a56e-2fed7f73269a-0
00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:04.985
We got a grant from MITACS and from NSERC
and from CIH or the equivalent of our NIH

5f88cbf6-65a2-45c7-a56e-2fed7f73269a-1
00:13:04.985 --> 00:13:06.200
up here in Canada.

3df268fc-3260-43a6-943c-16a4b31c64e2-0
00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:12.276
And we looked at the ability of different
oncogenes to be impaired by these

3df268fc-3260-43a6-943c-16a4b31c64e2-1
00:13:12.276 --> 00:13:13.200
antioxidants.

ef83af3e-4a10-4900-a708-fd5b074b015d-0
00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:15.280
We looked at different mechanisms of
action.

707835b6-3ead-4c65-abb7-a0a54c8b5e7c-0
00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:16.520
I very little time.

40037056-6d19-400e-8f52-9cfc96b64664-0
00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:18.320
So I won't go through all of that in
detail.

0e261dd4-5214-4684-af92-f5796b382d07-0
00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:22.620
But at a very cellular level,
we're able to demonstrate that N&amp;

0e261dd4-5214-4684-af92-f5796b382d07-1
00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:27.742
K acetate and nasty oncogene is inhibited
by antioxidants from causing damage in

0e261dd4-5214-4684-af92-f5796b382d07-2
00:13:27.742 --> 00:13:29.640
human bronchial alveoli cells.

5c0a61b7-7193-4d74-80c9-4cd07f55a48c-0
00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:33.720
And then we added methotrexate and we're
also able to show protection.

42022394-16e0-4b32-ad68-c989d07d7049-0
00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:38.901
We looked at the dietary role of
antioxidants in P53 mediated cancer and

42022394-16e0-4b32-ad68-c989d07d7049-1
00:13:38.901 --> 00:13:43.648
tumor suppression and we found that
there's there's a lot of evidence in the

42022394-16e0-4b32-ad68-c989d07d7049-2
00:13:43.648 --> 00:13:48.088
literature showing that dietary
antioxidants have a cellular protection

42022394-16e0-4b32-ad68-c989d07d7049-3
00:13:48.088 --> 00:13:48.520
effect.

96fe7300-51b6-43dc-af9f-c53ec3d0b852-0
00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:55.541
We then used a cell radiator,
again with CIHR and Circuit Mitex funding

96fe7300-51b6-43dc-af9f-c53ec3d0b852-1
00:13:55.541 --> 00:13:59.240
to look at human bronchial alveolar cells.

0f00982a-8c15-412b-a3ee-abaa1053ecd1-0
00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:02.200
We did several studies.

8624cb32-e8ba-4314-8402-395a0e3c0011-0
00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:06.402
We looked at double stranded DNA breaks
and we're able to show cellular

8624cb32-e8ba-4314-8402-395a0e3c0011-1
00:14:06.402 --> 00:14:10.080
protection using that technique in the in
the cellar radiator.

177a0910-1a31-472a-a8dd-fbe86ecd5493-0
00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:13.560
We looked at single stranded DNA damage
in comet assay.

9ef7fe53-1496-43cf-99bc-c4f30a133b34-0
00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:17.475
Again,
being able to show protection and having

9ef7fe53-1496-43cf-99bc-c4f30a133b34-1
00:14:17.475 --> 00:14:21.178
done this work,
we then went out to study mice at

9ef7fe53-1496-43cf-99bc-c4f30a133b34-2
00:14:21.178 --> 00:14:27.029
McMaster and mitochondria are are are
what were the key focus of that study in

9ef7fe53-1496-43cf-99bc-c4f30a133b34-3
00:14:27.029 --> 00:14:27.400
mice.

a526c8e8-0860-4dc3-8ab2-b3d067cbfc14-0
00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:31.648
Mitochondria are 13 times more sensitive
to radiation than nuclear DNA,

a526c8e8-0860-4dc3-8ab2-b3d067cbfc14-1
00:14:31.648 --> 00:14:33.160
purely maternal inheritance.

cf10fde5-778e-4547-81e4-49b8f0e4c6a5-0
00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:39.229
So biologically female interventional
cardiologists doing procedures could

cf10fde5-778e-4547-81e4-49b8f0e4c6a5-1
00:14:39.229 --> 00:14:41.920
transmit mutations across generations.

b1a3d6ce-dbb4-463c-8d81-cee18495096b-0
00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:43.680
OK, wrap your head around that.

c6f10215-5e63-477a-808d-be6ae0a40981-0
00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:49.960
Mitochondria have their own unique DNA
called mtDNA,

c6f10215-5e63-477a-808d-be6ae0a40981-1
00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:55.009
much more susceptible to radiation and
has a kind of a concatenation effect

c6f10215-5e63-477a-808d-be6ae0a40981-2
00:14:55.009 --> 00:14:57.600
where it, it perpetuates and increases.

38a797b3-d8bd-4ccf-9e6b-f0b9d6ba3d76-0
00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:02.000
And so we we wanted to target
mitochondria with this formulation.

9add3183-fc47-4ee0-b7ab-93430dab359e-0
00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:08.125
We studied mice in three groups,
control group, no radiation,

9add3183-fc47-4ee0-b7ab-93430dab359e-1
00:15:08.125 --> 00:15:13.640
radiation to the mice and then feeding
them our formulation.

5ebcab3c-b8a6-4e78-840d-f628e7b88f4d-0
00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:18.013
And we were able to demonstrate in mice,
heart, liver,

5ebcab3c-b8a6-4e78-840d-f628e7b88f4d-1
00:15:18.013 --> 00:15:23.520
brain that we could protect them at the
level of the control group by giving them

5ebcab3c-b8a6-4e78-840d-f628e7b88f4d-2
00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:28.960
the antioxidants and protect them from
DNA damage in the DNA, mitochondrial DNA.

26d069cf-a79d-4294-a634-49213349f454-0
00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:31.840
Mitochondrial DNA is really hard to study.

a6530458-8cb0-47ea-b4ae-d31be497e2a3-0
00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:33.640
Very, very few people can do this.

69bbd27b-1eae-404a-9bb6-ff60ee5bee83-0
00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:36.920
And Mark's lab is one of three or four in
the world that can do this.

0ae3eb50-a0b5-4305-93d7-688f2f17b975-0
00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:41.979
We then did a three arm single blinded
study at University Health Network,

0ae3eb50-a0b5-4305-93d7-688f2f17b975-1
00:15:41.979 --> 00:15:44.925
again funded by the Piedmont Cardiac
Center here,

0ae3eb50-a0b5-4305-93d7-688f2f17b975-2
00:15:44.925 --> 00:15:48.520
a brilliant foundation that we, we,
we have at the hospital.

260f74b4-1d12-49ab-97df-0414ed8458f1-0
00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:51.680
They fund all sorts of of things.

dba76cbb-83bd-4949-b326-d54eb40ae692-0
00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:56.614
And the blood was results were
interpreted by Mark's lab in a completely

dba76cbb-83bd-4949-b326-d54eb40ae692-1
00:15:56.614 --> 00:16:01.143
blinded way because they had no idea what
we were doing because they're in a

dba76cbb-83bd-4949-b326-d54eb40ae692-2
00:16:01.143 --> 00:16:03.320
separate hospital like 70 miles away.

8300b4e7-45d1-48a8-9a96-2f85e13c3402-0
00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:12.188
And here there was a study of folks
performing EVAR and you know, EVAR,

8300b4e7-45d1-48a8-9a96-2f85e13c3402-1
00:16:12.188 --> 00:16:19.502
aortic stenting, fenestrated, EVAR,
very big doses to the team,

8300b4e7-45d1-48a8-9a96-2f85e13c3402-2
00:16:19.502 --> 00:16:22.360
to the patient, etcetera.

2929e3f0-9266-49cd-9af0-31e9fc897e74-0
00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:28.840
And in that setting,
looking specifically at mitochondrial,

2929e3f0-9266-49cd-9af0-31e9fc897e74-1
00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:37.096
we're able to show that there was a 54%
decrease in mitochondrial DNA damage with

2929e3f0-9266-49cd-9af0-31e9fc897e74-2
00:16:37.096 --> 00:16:42.734
premedication in the teams performing
these procedures,

2929e3f0-9266-49cd-9af0-31e9fc897e74-3
00:16:42.734 --> 00:16:49.479
20 people and that there was a 72%
decrease in nuclear DNA damage.

0286ad77-7f96-4e79-a5d3-3e610c07bfa0-0
00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:57.235
So 54% decrease in mitochondrial damage,
74% decrease in nuclear DNA damage when

0286ad77-7f96-4e79-a5d3-3e610c07bfa0-1
00:16:57.235 --> 00:17:04.320
premedicated one hour prior to the EVAR
with an oral pill, Well, 2 pills.

9f177e85-582b-458c-bddd-081bddc709e3-0
00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:09.818
And we looked at individuals and we were
able to study their peripheral

9f177e85-582b-458c-bddd-081bddc709e3-1
00:17:09.818 --> 00:17:12.600
mononuclear cells and we did gamma, H2 OX,
etcetera.

9ea3bf81-34d6-4fa5-a415-6aa7051beefa-0
00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:17.699
And we found that some individuals had
much different responses to equal amounts

9ea3bf81-34d6-4fa5-a415-6aa7051beefa-1
00:17:17.699 --> 00:17:21.475
of radiation than others,
again showing individual variation in

9ea3bf81-34d6-4fa5-a415-6aa7051beefa-2
00:17:21.475 --> 00:17:22.360
responsiveness.

95f9aa2a-f367-4822-b8c5-c5b33196aae1-0
00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:26.538
Older interventionalists have greater
activation of their H2 OX repair system

95f9aa2a-f367-4822-b8c5-c5b33196aae1-1
00:17:26.538 --> 00:17:28.040
than younger interventionalists.

9f5c0c8c-5b1e-463b-b230-36d936308d1e-0
00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:34.575
This is important because it shows up
regulation of repair from chronic injury

9f5c0c8c-5b1e-463b-b230-36d936308d1e-1
00:17:34.575 --> 00:17:40.395
over time and that hasn't been shown
before screening of trainees and staff I

9f5c0c8c-5b1e-463b-b230-36d936308d1e-2
00:17:40.395 --> 00:17:42.560
think is emotionally complex.

df78ce09-bffa-404c-9dbe-11877d7152fd-0
00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:46.272
But saying to people before they choose a
life of intervention,

df78ce09-bffa-404c-9dbe-11877d7152fd-1
00:17:46.272 --> 00:17:49.452
before they choose 30-40 years of
radiation, hey, you know,

df78ce09-bffa-404c-9dbe-11877d7152fd-2
00:17:49.452 --> 00:17:51.360
do you want to talk to a geneticist?

a50137eb-22e7-4787-915b-961e2a2c4be4-0
00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:55.457
Do you want to see, I mean, do you,
does your mum have a history of breast

a50137eb-22e7-4787-915b-961e2a2c4be4-1
00:17:55.457 --> 00:17:55.840
cancer?

cc962310-2792-48bd-bf7c-76a072fb01cb-0
00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:57.240
Do your aunts have breast cancer?

c51413d3-7926-47ff-ac99-42a27ec6e93a-0
00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:00.960
Any history of BRCA one and two AP 53
mutation?

9562a85e-0442-40ce-a855-0aaba8327326-0
00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:04.189
Because if that's the case,
maybe you get screened and,

9562a85e-0442-40ce-a855-0aaba8327326-1
00:18:04.189 --> 00:18:07.963
and if you have it, then you decide, hey,
I'm going to be screened for breast

9562a85e-0442-40ce-a855-0aaba8327326-2
00:18:07.963 --> 00:18:09.560
cancer myself or prostate cancer.

0637e377-9e1d-4912-94f0-09fc41d6d09f-0
00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:14.440
But also maybe I shouldn't be an
interventional cardiologist.

967aa89d-33f0-4a31-91ac-716d404871e9-0
00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:19.777
But that's an ethically complex
conversation that has to occur in the

967aa89d-33f0-4a31-91ac-716d404871e9-1
00:18:19.777 --> 00:18:23.280
right emotional context,
a well informed conversation.

a60d542c-384e-44c8-94e4-13c0bfd53430-0
00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:26.280
We have some data now to initiate those
kind of thoughts.

a3517c97-8068-49e1-86b3-e68a38f36cc7-0
00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:31.076
We haven't had that kind of sophisticated
conversation about radiation risk before

a3517c97-8068-49e1-86b3-e68a38f36cc7-1
00:18:31.076 --> 00:18:32.640
in our world, but we need to.

549ae6cb-cb09-49c4-8f7d-f4dd8919586e-0
00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:40.365
These are mutations that are known in
interventional cardiologists to have been

549ae6cb-cb09-49c4-8f7d-f4dd8919586e-1
00:18:40.365 --> 00:18:45.800
associated with the development of
cancers from their occupational exposure.

53346692-88fa-4cb3-8680-a56de68dae4f-0
00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:46.720
OK.

2fc46a89-32b1-485b-a8e7-6cb29e4cd43c-0
00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:50.718
I mean,
this is something well established in the

2fc46a89-32b1-485b-a8e7-6cb29e4cd43c-1
00:18:50.718 --> 00:18:55.280
oncology literature,
and about 50% of them are P53 mutations.

127df539-6976-494e-8736-43b3fe844d5e-0
00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:57.320
But there's a ton of literature on this.

4ad7dac7-24f8-481b-8a84-3c4dfb67ff87-0
00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:59.560
Why don't we discuss that more?

26581955-38ac-424d-a7d0-de6208fddf73-0
00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:01.920
We should just,
this is a conversation worth having.

989a4194-552c-43b8-8fcb-950ca0a53862-0
00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:07.560
This is not just about barriers in that,
OK, we talk about personalized medicine.

f0595485-bab9-4b86-93a8-44b894f460b4-0
00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:11.440
Should we make personalized career
choices based on our DNA repair ability?

1433ed70-7536-4963-8294-0f583fc14c37-0
00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:12.720
That's worth considering.

55909e53-7eaf-491d-9c04-cf6012b99d14-0
00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:16.440
It begins with family and personal
history.

6289788e-96a2-4b00-abff-f2314df8e05f-0
00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:20.680
If genetic screening occurs,
1 might look for mutations and snips.

e6f3c1ed-717a-42a7-b113-5aaef8126f86-0
00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:26.102
Snips are more common than mutations and
some thoughts BRCA one and two in

e6f3c1ed-717a-42a7-b113-5aaef8126f86-1
00:19:26.102 --> 00:19:26.880
particular.

532ecc67-68db-496e-b4d8-00a0ba11a7f1-0
00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:28.040
We need to look for this.

901e3896-02e7-4ecf-a1b4-aa4272cdd10f-0
00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:32.170
It's very common in the Ashkenazi Jewish
population and people from Iceland,

901e3896-02e7-4ecf-a1b4-aa4272cdd10f-1
00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:34.960
Scandinavia,
German span over the Spain and France.

6fbbe6e6-5ac0-416c-ad86-007ccade3818-0
00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:44.498
Both male and female carriers of this P53
guardian of the genome ensures genetic

6fbbe6e6-5ac0-416c-ad86-007ccade3818-1
00:19:44.498 --> 00:19:47.760
stability is key to repair response.

fa7c9191-9b5a-4c19-8872-ace6384230a0-0
00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:54.167
This is a critical thing to look for if
we're going to look for somebody's secure

fa7c9191-9b5a-4c19-8872-ace6384230a0-1
00:19:54.167 --> 00:19:55.840
occupation in the future.

8138afa0-4f7f-4c87-8120-aa79dc6ad14d-0
00:19:56.400 --> 00:20:01.929
ATM mutations, ataxiatellinjectasia,
you know, present in breast cancer,

8138afa0-4f7f-4c87-8120-aa79dc6ad14d-1
00:20:01.929 --> 00:20:04.960
lymphoid tumors decreases repairability.

1cac13c9-6e7b-4c30-85e9-e8f204da5141-0
00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:09.280
Mitochondrial DNA very difficult to study.

fac37693-2891-44a2-815d-6e01877a183e-0
00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:11.960
Purely maternal transmission.

9e190474-701c-42fa-b277-0d323b814a36-0
00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:14.280
Fascinating, isn't it?

4b797bd0-9421-4ed4-9089-9d1be5b3ae37-0
00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:17.640
All our mitochondria are from our mother.

aac59d47-1e31-4307-8d8f-f70d58221900-0
00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:24.000
Can occupational radiation result in
mutations that cross generations?

9e7f2459-b848-4aae-ada9-44e79e1e3c69-0
00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:25.640
We need to discuss that.

d18759ed-68f3-4bd6-a738-bf20e23f380a-0
00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:33.400
Now there's the larger picture of nuclear
accidents, first responders, dirty bombs.

2cc07dde-e378-4e42-8494-2289500d5c36-0
00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:34.760
How do we protect them?

11c757bc-1012-40d1-9b00-d6fee2160b23-0
00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:36.960
This, this formulation could help them.

642b0945-0883-4af7-8bb1-bd37a6ddf8a8-0
00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:40.360
There's an issue of stockpiling.

874be03b-b7b0-49f6-819c-af501e8a15bb-0
00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:45.130
You know,
the world is in a delicate balance right

874be03b-b7b0-49f6-819c-af501e8a15bb-1
00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:51.280
now with bad actors who are armed with
nuclear weapons, who are untrustworthy.

6afbfecf-a527-4ca2-a90d-1ddeed1327d1-0
00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:54.920
And we need to think about the fact that
iodine is not enough.

066f75b4-d3ce-4756-bf36-bb04ac5e7602-0
00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:01.229
Two years ago, I shipped 20,
000 pills to the Ukrainian army around

066f75b4-d3ce-4756-bf36-bb04ac5e7602-1
00:21:01.229 --> 00:21:06.283
the Zafrazia power plant with the help of
a fabulous group of young men called

066f75b4-d3ce-4756-bf36-bb04ac5e7602-2
00:21:06.283 --> 00:21:10.761
August Mission and the help of the
ambassador to the Organization for

066f75b4-d3ce-4756-bf36-bb04ac5e7602-3
00:21:10.761 --> 00:21:13.000
Security and Cooperation in Europe.

c25a77c3-fc38-4f5e-a2b9-78f491c30d85-0
00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:15.440
So that's translation.

01ef841d-9ae7-472d-b1fc-5e5c42f4b602-0
00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:17.320
We talk about translation of our science.

4a0108a3-15e9-4bcc-b093-0e760c66557a-0
00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:19.480
That's benched trench, right?

00c07038-066f-46ae-8798-6ff036b51cb4-0
00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:27.219
And we got these amazing pictures back of
Ukrainian troops holding bottles of our

00c07038-066f-46ae-8798-6ff036b51cb4-1
00:21:27.219 --> 00:21:31.040
pills in bunkers around that nuclear site.

ed78fd0e-f92e-4dc2-96ab-ef8359cd0e7f-0
00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:34.120
I want to thank you for letting me speak.

1bf55371-1a4f-4c66-81d5-2cb317f97bc2-0
00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:37.582
I want to thank the Peter Moncardiac
Center for,

1bf55371-1a4f-4c66-81d5-2cb317f97bc2-1
00:21:37.582 --> 00:21:42.518
for supporting this work and for our
equivalent of the NIH, the CIH or N Sirk,

1bf55371-1a4f-4c66-81d5-2cb317f97bc2-2
00:21:42.518 --> 00:21:46.455
the folks at Dalhousie at McMaster,
my colleague Peter Carlin,

1bf55371-1a4f-4c66-81d5-2cb317f97bc2-3
00:21:46.455 --> 00:21:49.767
who's completely mad,
Dave Nicholas and Joe Barfitt,

1bf55371-1a4f-4c66-81d5-2cb317f97bc2-4
00:21:49.767 --> 00:21:52.080
who I started this with 15 years ago.

a785da08-8b35-4c1c-a8a5-cbe5f5777dfd-0
00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:55.197
And I'm, I'm,
I'm very grateful to you for the

a785da08-8b35-4c1c-a8a5-cbe5f5777dfd-1
00:21:55.197 --> 00:21:55.840
opportunity.

6feec1da-2dff-4083-8aef-c0f3ea509776-0
00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:58.760
I hope it makes you think think
differently about radiation.

e2ed1447-0c27-4812-8e71-4912bc531f8f-0
00:21:58.880 --> 00:21:59.280
Thank you.

23ee4a51-e270-4d12-9c9f-6ce86e3eeedb-0
00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:05.320
Hello, my name is Doctor Lauren Ramsey.

b0d074f5-e791-400f-bab9-b2c0890e6391-0
00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:09.185
I am a breast cancer surgeon in Fort
Worth,

b0d074f5-e791-400f-bab9-b2c0890e6391-1
00:22:09.185 --> 00:22:16.300
TX and today I'm going to be speaking on
breast cancer and the link to radiation

b0d074f5-e791-400f-bab9-b2c0890e6391-2
00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:18.759
exposure for my disclosures.

2a8290d3-bd11-4d06-9ec7-15eb30981e58-0
00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:24.763
I am a consultant for Burlington Medical,
so I wanted to start out by talking about

2a8290d3-bd11-4d06-9ec7-15eb30981e58-1
00:22:24.763 --> 00:22:28.480
the landscape of breast cancer in the
21st century.

3c84d832-4683-43fe-9970-3526bdb5eb0d-0
00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:30.880
Why are we worried about breast cancer?

f2d2e252-b704-4951-9498-344bfa032651-0
00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:33.520
And you know,
what does it mean to us on a daily basis?

29819699-33bd-4b12-9f32-b80752fc33ec-0
00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:36.120
Well, breast cancer is a big problem.

db6e5e77-8d60-48bf-818f-33d996b8ad8f-0
00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:38.560
It's the world's most prevalent cancer.

031e69ea-fb5c-4eb2-b4e4-8314d5d46567-0
00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:41.080
It's something that we all have
encountered.

10ade468-0247-4cd1-b460-4433951ad264-0
00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:43.641
I feel like everyone knows a family
member,

10ade468-0247-4cd1-b460-4433951ad264-1
00:22:43.641 --> 00:22:46.320
a friend who's been affected by this
disease.

52583c91-9b06-4689-84d4-2fae9b564cbf-0
00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:51.242
In 2022, there were 2.
3 million women diagnosed with breast

52583c91-9b06-4689-84d4-2fae9b564cbf-1
00:22:51.242 --> 00:22:54.418
cancer,
and among new diagnosis of cancers,

52583c91-9b06-4689-84d4-2fae9b564cbf-2
00:22:54.418 --> 00:22:56.800
breast cancer is the most common.

68810973-f2f4-408a-b9c1-6f63e0bd4e12-0
00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:59.680
These are facts from the World Health
Organization.

b98b6a73-7393-4a9f-821d-33da59f42af3-0
00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:03.560
So when it comes to risk factors for
breast cancer,

b98b6a73-7393-4a9f-821d-33da59f42af3-1
00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:07.360
we know that there are lifestyle and
environmental risk factors.

5d9756ee-4c8e-4aa6-a3bd-2b80ffb25877-0
00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:12.451
You can see in the bottom graphic that
these are just some of the most common

5d9756ee-4c8e-4aa6-a3bd-2b80ffb25877-1
00:23:12.451 --> 00:23:13.160
risk factors.

aa6063c3-2a5c-412e-b410-63e7b124fcbf-0
00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:14.360
But age.

c776f37d-1035-4619-9d02-8afd7ab19ce3-0
00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:18.986
So as women get older, gender,
the female gender, things like alcohol,

c776f37d-1035-4619-9d02-8afd7ab19ce3-1
00:23:18.986 --> 00:23:23.091
your genetics, some,
some people have a genetic predisposition

c776f37d-1035-4619-9d02-8afd7ab19ce3-2
00:23:23.091 --> 00:23:26.480
to have breast cancer with a certain gene
mutation.

b5414158-9cff-4868-b2e4-499d20232817-0
00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:29.120
Obesity is a risk factor for breast
cancer.

ce98cb8f-c15b-4659-95c0-e8a252ad1f8a-0
00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:33.560
And you can also see that radiation is a
risk factor for breast cancer.

b356faec-66f8-49fe-83ca-7d0bef406cd9-0
00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:35.960
So I'm going to get more into this next.

bbf2bdce-2b6e-4109-b068-67e0dee640d1-0
00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:42.221
So when it comes to radiation exposure
and breast cancer,

bbf2bdce-2b6e-4109-b068-67e0dee640d1-1
00:23:42.221 --> 00:23:47.328
we know that breast tissue is a sensitive
tissue to the carcinogenic actions of

bbf2bdce-2b6e-4109-b068-67e0dee640d1-2
00:23:47.328 --> 00:23:52.306
radiation and we know that radiation
exposure is a modifiable risk factor for

bbf2bdce-2b6e-4109-b068-67e0dee640d1-3
00:23:52.306 --> 00:23:53.200
breast cancer.

2a9fe119-9c4b-4b04-b412-5054b77649d3-0
00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:59.441
So when I say modifiable risk factor,
we typically break up risk factors into

2a9fe119-9c4b-4b04-b412-5054b77649d3-1
00:23:59.441 --> 00:24:02.720
two segments,
modifiable and non modifiable.

4f6568f0-841e-413f-8d76-9c048044e058-0
00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:07.548
So your non modifiable things are things
like your genes or your age,

4f6568f0-841e-413f-8d76-9c048044e058-1
00:24:07.548 --> 00:24:12.125
things that you were just born with,
like you're if you have the genetic

4f6568f0-841e-413f-8d76-9c048044e058-2
00:24:12.125 --> 00:24:15.762
mutation of BRCA,
that would put you at a higher risk for

4f6568f0-841e-413f-8d76-9c048044e058-3
00:24:15.762 --> 00:24:16.639
breast cancer.

d9720e1d-3722-4da9-a29a-90df69f14fd0-0
00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:20.560
So these are things that you just can't
modify simply that's because how you were

d9720e1d-3722-4da9-a29a-90df69f14fd0-1
00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:20.800
born.

d81049f6-01a0-48e9-83cc-3a6cbc08b55d-0
00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:23.888
But when it comes to modifiable risk
factors,

d81049f6-01a0-48e9-83cc-3a6cbc08b55d-1
00:24:23.888 --> 00:24:27.920
these are things that we can actually
adjust and can actually change.

19ac335b-c1eb-4faa-a812-4cdbbba17bd9-0
00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:32.597
So we can, if it's obesity, you know,
you can lose weight, alcohol consumption,

19ac335b-c1eb-4faa-a812-4cdbbba17bd9-1
00:24:32.597 --> 00:24:35.840
you can reduce your alcohol intake and
radiation exposure.

c1a20c3d-8270-4489-88a8-3c4539ce086a-0
00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:39.920
You can reduce your radiation exposure or
better protect yourself from radiation.

1944ca7f-6917-4a1c-a93e-0a088f52f505-0
00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:42.160
There have been several studies.

b11b6efe-fe14-4a2b-9f9a-115ee1f36fa6-0
00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:46.150
You can see my citations at the bottom of
the slide that talk about the higher

b11b6efe-fe14-4a2b-9f9a-115ee1f36fa6-1
00:24:46.150 --> 00:24:50.040
incidence of breast cancer and healthcare
providers who work with radiation.

9a05c51e-7aa0-4fd4-80ca-7e80f8026b33-0
00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:55.406
So there's a higher incidence of breast
cancer and radiologic technicians, sorry,

9a05c51e-7aa0-4fd4-80ca-7e80f8026b33-1
00:24:55.406 --> 00:25:00.390
radiologic technologist and there's also
a higher incidence of breast cancer and

9a05c51e-7aa0-4fd4-80ca-7e80f8026b33-2
00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:01.560
orthopedic surgeon.

989c03b8-f23b-42ed-91ab-3b85e05bc930-0
00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:05.360
So the studies have shown about a 2.
9 fold increase.

ef342b7e-e771-4978-94b5-0fb410de2829-0
00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:10.002
Some of the studies show up even higher
than a three fold increase in prevalence

ef342b7e-e771-4978-94b5-0fb410de2829-1
00:25:10.002 --> 00:25:14.373
of breast cancer and orthopedic surgeons
when they're compared with women of a

ef342b7e-e771-4978-94b5-0fb410de2829-2
00:25:14.373 --> 00:25:15.480
similar demographic.

2a97beec-7f66-4d90-89f0-87562efe10c0-0
00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:19.307
So the studies have mostly been done in
orthopedic surgeons,

2a97beec-7f66-4d90-89f0-87562efe10c0-1
00:25:19.307 --> 00:25:23.249
but there are more studies now looking at
interventional radiologists,

2a97beec-7f66-4d90-89f0-87562efe10c0-2
00:25:23.249 --> 00:25:25.748
interventional cardiologists,
neurosurgeons,

2a97beec-7f66-4d90-89f0-87562efe10c0-3
00:25:25.748 --> 00:25:29.080
just any surgeon who is around repeated
radiation exposure.

2cafc439-26b9-48a3-8116-0d7c12a9bfcd-0
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:38.000
One of the theories behind this is that
the upper outer quadrant of the breast

2cafc439-26b9-48a3-8116-0d7c12a9bfcd-1
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.938
can be exposed to more high doses of
radiation because the standard lead vest

2cafc439-26b9-48a3-8116-0d7c12a9bfcd-2
00:25:42.938 --> 00:25:46.040
and apron does not adequately protect
this area.

b62d3f5a-9a12-4ab3-b417-f3b4115ba367-0
00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:49.058
So when you just look at general
population,

b62d3f5a-9a12-4ab3-b417-f3b4115ba367-1
00:25:49.058 --> 00:25:53.537
the most common site of breast cancer is
actually the upper outer quadrant of the

b62d3f5a-9a12-4ab3-b417-f3b4115ba367-2
00:25:53.537 --> 00:25:53.920
breast.

6384adab-e699-4f61-a5ed-454db619e044-0
00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:58.195
And this area,
as many of you know who work and radiate

6384adab-e699-4f61-a5ed-454db619e044-1
00:25:58.195 --> 00:26:01.963
with radiation,
that the vest usually leaves that area

6384adab-e699-4f61-a5ed-454db619e044-2
00:26:01.963 --> 00:26:04.840
very vulnerable to the radiation exposure.

98097c30-719f-4b06-9c4f-904b9979b40b-0
00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:07.920
So a study by Valone ET al.

68365629-cab8-47f4-8186-d18300196493-0
00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:12.631
Showed that the upper outer quadrant of
the breast actually does receive higher

68365629-cab8-47f4-8186-d18300196493-1
00:26:12.631 --> 00:26:17.579
doses of scatter radiation and especially
when the lead or the radiation protection

68365629-cab8-47f4-8186-d18300196493-2
00:26:17.579 --> 00:26:20.936
does not fit correctly,
there's a higher dose of scatter

68365629-cab8-47f4-8186-d18300196493-3
00:26:20.936 --> 00:26:22.880
radiation that reaches that area.

91b2e71d-a433-4694-8b15-c2bca3ccdb7f-0
00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:28.600
And this is because the radiation
actually projects upward from the source.

7d258218-5a25-44a4-990e-8592a2f0dd17-0
00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:33.720
So you can see in my figure that you have
your radiation source below the patient.

e1bfb306-75fb-4fdb-b14a-05b19a436fa9-0
00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:37.320
It goes through the patient and projects
outwards and upwards.

26258d1b-e818-455d-969b-74d16a5e761f-0
00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:43.275
And often time this scatter radiation is
hitting the upper outer quadrant of the

26258d1b-e818-455d-969b-74d16a5e761f-1
00:26:43.275 --> 00:26:46.473
breast,
which is not being protected by your

26258d1b-e818-455d-969b-74d16a5e761f-2
00:26:46.473 --> 00:26:50.240
standard vest,
the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

4582aef0-31e2-4416-a6ed-8370351c2e61-0
00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:53.553
So in the United States,
this is what sets a dose limits on

4582aef0-31e2-4416-a6ed-8370351c2e61-1
00:26:53.553 --> 00:26:55.320
occupational radiation exposure.

8147a8b9-d2e8-4eaf-9328-bafcdc968b2c-0
00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:58.385
You know,
they look at a lot of different organs,

8147a8b9-d2e8-4eaf-9328-bafcdc968b2c-1
00:26:58.385 --> 00:27:01.560
but they do not have a regulation number
for the breast.

55723962-f1c4-4781-bfb7-1d4757b2d114-0
00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:02.640
There's no dose limits.

422ca075-2e31-4d07-b7a7-f029acddc9c2-0
00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:05.360
So breast is just grouped in with any
organ.

fd5c26a9-cc02-4076-95cb-a2a1b375f0ad-0
00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:10.668
So this just makes me think that maybe
it's time that we really consider the

fd5c26a9-cc02-4076-95cb-a2a1b375f0ad-1
00:27:10.668 --> 00:27:13.738
breast specifically as an organ and as
tissue,

fd5c26a9-cc02-4076-95cb-a2a1b375f0ad-2
00:27:13.738 --> 00:27:17.200
and we maybe make regulations to protect
the breast.

f8f2c9f3-7f31-4987-b679-bcba71890551-0
00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:24.218
The American Medical Association has
recently discovered this and they

f8f2c9f3-7f31-4987-b679-bcba71890551-1
00:27:24.218 --> 00:27:28.170
released this statement and it talks
about the things that I've kind of

f8f2c9f3-7f31-4987-b679-bcba71890551-2
00:27:28.170 --> 00:27:28.720
mentioned.

30a65e8a-2b02-4e85-875b-77a4c7046044-0
00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:33.130
So at the top you can see where they talk
about the standard aprons often leave the

30a65e8a-2b02-4e85-875b-77a4c7046044-1
00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:35.440
upper outer quadrant of the breast
exposed.

30f7863f-50a9-47ff-9760-74802688f284-0
00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:40.152
And this is a common sight of breast
cancer in recent studies have shown that

30f7863f-50a9-47ff-9760-74802688f284-1
00:27:40.152 --> 00:27:44.300
there's an increased risk of breast
cancer among female surgeons who are

30f7863f-50a9-47ff-9760-74802688f284-2
00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:47.880
exposed to ionizing radiation during
image guiding procedures.

f5de2bb8-2901-4b6f-afd5-cc77553f19ac-0
00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:51.891
Sorry, not just surgeons,
but also any healthcare provider who's

f5de2bb8-2901-4b6f-afd5-cc77553f19ac-1
00:27:51.891 --> 00:27:53.280
exposed to any radiation.

8b7f8c4e-02ef-4df4-9858-fc3d8fee8146-0
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.920
So their resolution is that they are
encouraging institutions to ensure more

8b7f8c4e-02ef-4df4-9858-fc3d8fee8146-1
00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:04.032
comprehensive coverage of this area of
the body by by providing protection that

8b7f8c4e-02ef-4df4-9858-fc3d8fee8146-2
00:28:04.032 --> 00:28:09.080
more completely protects the whole breast,
including the upper outer quadrant.

f55e90ae-712e-4b1b-a0f5-a61615c13ffb-0
00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:15.040
So next I wanted to talk about our
research.

77d44f0a-1b13-476d-a54f-56f08fcf45bc-0
00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:20.513
This is a paper that we published in the
Health Physics Journal and we talk about

77d44f0a-1b13-476d-a54f-56f08fcf45bc-1
00:28:20.513 --> 00:28:21.680
protecting our own.

64433cd4-87e7-42e9-aab1-2192813d72d6-0
00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:25.605
So protecting healthcare providers and a
method to reduce breast radiation

64433cd4-87e7-42e9-aab1-2192813d72d6-1
00:28:25.605 --> 00:28:27.280
exposure and healthcare workers.

35cd32c9-8d45-4b88-bd4d-909d95d6966d-0
00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:34.160
The purpose of our study was to test a
novel shield.

f56495e2-c9e2-479c-831b-80527908bc14-0
00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:38.532
This is called the BAT shield because it
specifically protects the breast,

f56495e2-c9e2-479c-831b-80527908bc14-1
00:28:38.532 --> 00:28:39.600
axilla and thyroid.

1032675b-7951-4c82-b96e-9bd1cceb2573-0
00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:43.566
So BAT and we wanted to make sure that it
protected the breast,

1032675b-7951-4c82-b96e-9bd1cceb2573-1
00:28:43.566 --> 00:28:48.525
but it also was mobile and comfortable
for the operator to wear and that it was

1032675b-7951-4c82-b96e-9bd1cceb2573-2
00:28:48.525 --> 00:28:52.120
universally compatible with standard lead
aprons or vest.

bc02de15-5bb2-4349-8789-9fa3fa1dc9f9-0
00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:55.800
So it didn't require any specific
attachments or modifications.

fb7b2343-2960-4ec7-b3f1-e1f811182467-0
00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:02.337
What we did is we simulated a procedure
room with a phantom and AC arm and we

fb7b2343-2960-4ec7-b3f1-e1f811182467-1
00:29:02.337 --> 00:29:07.400
placed dosimeters to the operator
quadrant of the breast, to the thyroid,

fb7b2343-2960-4ec7-b3f1-e1f811182467-2
00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:10.480
to the chest and to the deep spinal
tissues.

d9820173-10f2-4faf-89af-7d0d397a88a1-0
00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:15.915
And we just tested different operator
positions and we compared the standard

d9820173-10f2-4faf-89af-7d0d397a88a1-1
00:29:15.915 --> 00:29:21.300
lead vest just the with a thyroid shield
compared to a standard lead vest plus the

d9820173-10f2-4faf-89af-7d0d397a88a1-2
00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:21.560
BAT.

be3d97c6-3b0e-48f1-9b90-4a23a7f5b43d-0
00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:27.840
So this is a, a picture,
a diagram of our methods.

059a1d8f-0c16-41ba-a19a-18ffc1e4d8c1-0
00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:33.252
This is kind of how we have the operator
either facing the patient or 90° to the

059a1d8f-0c16-41ba-a19a-18ffc1e4d8c1-1
00:29:33.252 --> 00:29:35.480
patient and the different positions.

b9556d18-aa09-45e1-900d-b5672ded0797-0
00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:44.782
Here are results that whenever the
phantom was wearing the standard apron

b9556d18-aa09-45e1-900d-b5672ded0797-1
00:29:44.782 --> 00:29:48.630
plus the BAT,
there was a significant reduction in

b9556d18-aa09-45e1-900d-b5672ded0797-2
00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:51.120
radiation for all anatomic areas.

2d63a54a-250a-48d2-ab8d-b2cf064b6bef-0
00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:55.721
So you can see in the graph,
the teal cover is just a standard vest

2d63a54a-250a-48d2-ab8d-b2cf064b6bef-1
00:29:55.721 --> 00:29:59.713
with a thyroid shield,
but the blue is a standard vest plus the

2d63a54a-250a-48d2-ab8d-b2cf064b6bef-2
00:29:59.713 --> 00:30:00.399
BAT shield.

70737e3a-a484-4dbc-b4ff-72b7af3afcb5-0
00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:03.455
So you can see that the chest,
the deep tissue,

70737e3a-a484-4dbc-b4ff-72b7af3afcb5-1
00:30:03.455 --> 00:30:07.673
the far breast and the near breast and
the thyroid all had a reduction in

70737e3a-a484-4dbc-b4ff-72b7af3afcb5-2
00:30:07.673 --> 00:30:09.440
radiation when wearing the BAT.

1c295b62-cb7e-4fbb-a708-f835ecb5d82b-0
00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:14.040
Most prominently you can see the near
breast.

48b31c74-f87b-41d1-aefa-c3c315e417c1-0
00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:17.360
So this is the breast that is nearest the
radiation exposure.

a7b388ab-b1bb-441a-982b-ea660d2da5e3-0
00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:22.396
And you can see the dramatic reduction of
radiation exposure when wearing this

a7b388ab-b1bb-441a-982b-ea660d2da5e3-1
00:30:22.396 --> 00:30:23.480
protective shield.

a5300df2-227e-4b0a-baab-716ac216751b-0
00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:31.460
So for different operator positions,
the breast nearest the radiation exposure,

a5300df2-227e-4b0a-baab-716ac216751b-1
00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:35.720
it had reductions ranging from 71.
4% to 97.7%.

2d18d6b6-34ed-43a6-ad1e-0b918ce2906d-0
00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.644
So in conclusion,
the standard lead vest often leaves gaps

2d18d6b6-34ed-43a6-ad1e-0b918ce2906d-1
00:30:43.644 --> 00:30:47.720
for radiation exposure,
especially to the upper outer quadrant of

2d18d6b6-34ed-43a6-ad1e-0b918ce2906d-2
00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:48.400
the breast.

30e89a0e-4ec7-449e-b611-3bbca3e43749-0
00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:51.189
And as I said,
this is the most common site of breast

30e89a0e-4ec7-449e-b611-3bbca3e43749-1
00:30:51.189 --> 00:30:51.520
cancer.

3cd30bdb-3eec-4266-8ada-5acaf3b6b048-0
00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:56.962
We know that breast cancer is
radiosensitive and radiation exposure has

3cd30bdb-3eec-4266-8ada-5acaf3b6b048-1
00:30:56.962 --> 00:30:58.800
been linked to breast cancer.

f8c02ffa-8b28-45ac-9cf3-ab412220d45e-0
00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:02.988
The year multiple studies showing the
higher rates of breast cancer and

f8c02ffa-8b28-45ac-9cf3-ab412220d45e-1
00:31:02.988 --> 00:31:05.000
healthcare providers who work with
radiation.

7ac1b82c-e608-44f0-94d5-fc13fe004b55-0
00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:11.091
So some solutions to decrease radiation
exposure to the breast are to reduce our

7ac1b82c-e608-44f0-94d5-fc13fe004b55-1
00:31:11.091 --> 00:31:14.611
duration of exposure,
to increase the distance from the

7ac1b82c-e608-44f0-94d5-fc13fe004b55-2
00:31:14.611 --> 00:31:18.131
radiation source,
and to make sure that all workers are

7ac1b82c-e608-44f0-94d5-fc13fe004b55-3
00:31:18.131 --> 00:31:20.960
shielded with effective protective
garments.

28539ca4-b6dd-4ff8-bfd8-c22c31b7a4de-0
00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:24.549
So you have your standard gown which
covers your torso,

28539ca4-b6dd-4ff8-bfd8-c22c31b7a4de-1
00:31:24.549 --> 00:31:27.760
your reproductive organs,
your femur and your thyroid.

a46d7abe-e3cf-47b5-afe3-229ff1e87551-0
00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:32.660
But it's time that we look at things like
axillary coverage or sleeves or or

a46d7abe-e3cf-47b5-afe3-229ff1e87551-1
00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:37.460
garments like the BAT that had been found
to decrease radiation to the operator

a46d7abe-e3cf-47b5-afe3-229ff1e87551-2
00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:38.840
quadrant of the breast.

1107538b-45e3-498e-ae2d-1d3253d2b426-0
00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:44.428
I just think this is a very important for
all healthcare providers to be aware,

1107538b-45e3-498e-ae2d-1d3253d2b426-1
00:31:44.428 --> 00:31:46.160
not only women but also men.

4c5953a9-f81f-4d3e-8a03-729b83035280-0
00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:48.560
Men do have a risk of breast cancer.

2c8dc2cc-4e92-4eef-958b-f3aa59357b46-0
00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:52.882
And not only in our studies did we show
the reduction to the breast,

2c8dc2cc-4e92-4eef-958b-f3aa59357b46-1
00:31:52.882 --> 00:31:55.840
but also to the chest and the deep spinal
tissues.

f240a68d-d3ae-4b4b-9bf9-3ddd52c96ecd-0
00:31:55.840 --> 00:32:00.575
So this is like your bone marrow and can
contribute to things like leukemias and

f240a68d-d3ae-4b4b-9bf9-3ddd52c96ecd-1
00:32:00.575 --> 00:32:01.160
lymphomas.

c820abae-389d-4dd7-b14b-a7dacee366f9-0
00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:05.183
So having that extra protection I think
is very essential for all healthcare

c820abae-389d-4dd7-b14b-a7dacee366f9-1
00:32:05.183 --> 00:32:05.680
providers.

Hello,
I'm doctor Tom Egan from cardiovascular

798c917b-a524-4f12-a24b-81c21f557244-1

Associates affiliated with the Baptist
Health System in Birmingham, AL.

4ba155cc-d436-4a4d-bafa-ab89a984a8ea-0
00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:24.482
My topic this morning is more than skin,
deep vascular eye and inflammatory

4ba155cc-d436-4a4d-bafa-ab89a984a8ea-1
00:32:24.482 --> 00:32:30.365
effects of ionizing radiation in the Cath
lab for cardiac catheterization

4ba155cc-d436-4a4d-bafa-ab89a984a8ea-2
00:32:30.365 --> 00:32:31.240
procedures.

4fa94cd5-f5e7-4490-8a32-0581374b04e1-0
00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:35.440
I have nothing to disclose in relation to
this activity.

65be715f-27d4-4737-b3dd-de9e6fbd8fbd-0
00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:37.520
I have no conflicts of interest.

59135c91-f523-4d74-a538-b01721bb4ce2-0
00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:43.201
The objective this morning is
understanding ionizing radiation is

59135c91-f523-4d74-a538-b01721bb4ce2-1
00:32:43.201 --> 00:32:47.457
stochastic,
deterministic or tissue damage effects on

59135c91-f523-4d74-a538-b01721bb4ce2-2
00:32:47.457 --> 00:32:53.920
the skin, circulatory system and the eye,
and also as it relates to inflammation.

731d05f6-29f9-4c6e-94ff-1c1f6891dbcf-0
00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:58.080
Ionizing radiation is more than just skin
deep.

4832840a-64e0-47ae-b0b0-7f3b1200943d-0
00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:04.011
Emerging evidence from a number of
studies have shown the effects of

4832840a-64e0-47ae-b0b0-7f3b1200943d-1
00:33:04.011 --> 00:33:08.400
ionizing radiation to those that are
exposed to radiation.

f7410b34-7d13-4059-8093-9c28bd58eb5b-0
00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:14.517
Among interventional cardiologists,
those are some of the most exposed

f7410b34-7d13-4059-8093-9c28bd58eb5b-1
00:33:14.517 --> 00:33:17.400
invasive occupations in all of medicine.

32c64b61-acd6-405c-9bbb-947c8c8ac89a-0
00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:24.874
Many interventional cardiologists
undertake and perform very high volume

32c64b61-acd6-405c-9bbb-947c8c8ac89a-1
00:33:24.874 --> 00:33:28.120
procedures as it relates to radiation.

268b7317-3fbf-4c9e-8447-82cadfc5d13f-0
00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:32.584
For SCOPIC procedures,
those that have direct exposure and

268b7317-3fbf-4c9e-8447-82cadfc5d13f-1
00:33:32.584 --> 00:33:38.487
exposure through scatter radiation,
there are known occupational risk now and

268b7317-3fbf-4c9e-8447-82cadfc5d13f-2
00:33:38.487 --> 00:33:44.692
well published studies, both orthopedic,
stochastic or carcinogenic effects as it

268b7317-3fbf-4c9e-8447-82cadfc5d13f-3
00:33:44.692 --> 00:33:49.686
relates to skin cancer,
brain cancer and then other effects as it

268b7317-3fbf-4c9e-8447-82cadfc5d13f-4
00:33:49.686 --> 00:33:54.000
relates to the cataracts in the eye and
vascular issues.

d4453235-162e-4c74-8014-52839926824d-0
00:33:54.960 --> 00:34:01.799
We certainly have known for over 100
years that ionizing radiation in all

d4453235-162e-4c74-8014-52839926824d-1
00:34:01.799 --> 00:34:08.453
forms is carcinogenic and can be
affecting many of the organ systems in

d4453235-162e-4c74-8014-52839926824d-2
00:34:08.453 --> 00:34:09.840
the human body.

17836082-34f5-4bd7-9764-b4d08a31321d-0
00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:16.214
Most well known are those in the
hemopolytic system, the endocrine system,

17836082-34f5-4bd7-9764-b4d08a31321d-1
00:34:16.214 --> 00:34:18.440
and the gastrointestinal system.

57a1b08b-9209-4669-860b-d7c5ec3b0ffd-0
00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:25.654
But other systems within the human body
are also at risk for changes both direct

57a1b08b-9209-4669-860b-d7c5ec3b0ffd-1
00:34:25.654 --> 00:34:29.040
and indirect, leading to disease states.

85ac88ff-3215-469e-b297-3bea681f0cc8-0
00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:36.145
We certainly know that there are
knowledge gaps that remain and the risk

85ac88ff-3215-469e-b297-3bea681f0cc8-1
00:34:36.145 --> 00:34:41.236
are still poorly understand,
but because of recent epidemiological

85ac88ff-3215-469e-b297-3bea681f0cc8-2
00:34:41.236 --> 00:34:44.578
studies,
there is more evidence to show how

85ac88ff-3215-469e-b297-3bea681f0cc8-3
00:34:44.578 --> 00:34:50.808
stochastic effects can affect the human
body negatively to those that are exposed

85ac88ff-3215-469e-b297-3bea681f0cc8-4
00:34:50.808 --> 00:34:52.480
to ionizing radiation.

4a3181f3-8c63-490a-9a9b-a95d1b1884e4-0
00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:56.514
More recently,
there have been better protection,

4a3181f3-8c63-490a-9a9b-a95d1b1884e4-1
00:34:56.514 --> 00:35:01.106
better protective devices, dosimeters,
protective equipment, etcetera,

4a3181f3-8c63-490a-9a9b-a95d1b1884e4-2
00:35:01.106 --> 00:35:05.699
and changes in the regulatory
recommendations for occupations that are

4a3181f3-8c63-490a-9a9b-a95d1b1884e4-3
00:35:05.699 --> 00:35:07.639
exposed to ionizing radiation.

052cb0e6-ed21-4c75-85ee-563235a2371b-0
00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:14.804
If you look on the diagram on the left,
I published this article in the Journal

052cb0e6-ed21-4c75-85ee-563235a2371b-1
00:35:14.804 --> 00:35:20.502
of Interventional Cardiology in 2011
regarding an interventional cardiologist

that had a number of skin cancers that
developed on exposed area of his skin.

8d55c51d-f32c-4fd3-928a-0f92c8d5ce2a-0
00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:32.219
You can see from the diagram the standard
lead apron that was worn and most of the

8d55c51d-f32c-4fd3-928a-0f92c8d5ce2a-1
00:35:32.219 --> 00:35:36.400
skin cancers at that time had developed
on the left side of this

A follow up study on this individual in
2017 published and CCI into 2017 show

d4b3a745-1c92-4faf-9e6a-50cb06ad049a-1
00:35:46.364 --> 00:35:53.836
that this individual cardiologist who
continued to do procedures developed over

d4b3a745-1c92-4faf-9e6a-50cb06ad049a-2

00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:06.268
We have research and cohorts,
specifically the lifetime study of atomic

c48a0648-6388-490a-90b1-c187f59ec32d-1
00:36:06.268 --> 00:36:12.075
bomb survivors from Japan,
over 60 years of data in that study with

c48a0648-6388-490a-90b1-c187f59ec32d-2
00:36:12.075 --> 00:36:16.003
over 100,

c48a0648-6388-490a-90b1-c187f59ec32d-3
00:36:16.003 --> 00:36:22.407
ionizing radiation to those that were
exposed to those two atomic bombs in

c48a0648-6388-490a-90b1-c187f59ec32d-4

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:30.773
We also have studies and other cohorts of
radiation accidents such as the Chernobyl

dc411b11-13f2-4622-80ba-c020dbfe2037-1
00:36:30.773 --> 00:36:37.381
accident and radiation workers in Russia,
as well as France and the US that have

00:36:37.381 --> 00:36:43.827
given new insights into the exposure of
these individuals to radiation and its

00:36:43.827 --> 00:36:44.479
effects.

00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:50.601
We've always known since the beginning of
radiation, and this was published in 1902,

6715908a-ba2a-4aaa-bced-b07a085d9203-1
00:36:50.601 --> 00:36:55.111
that there are direct effects,
what we call deterministic effects,

6715908a-ba2a-4aaa-bced-b07a085d9203-2
00:36:55.111 --> 00:36:59.149
actual cell death,
to tissues exposed to ionizing radiation

6715908a-ba2a-4aaa-bced-b07a085d9203-3
00:36:59.149 --> 00:37:01.640
and specifically tissues of the skin.

00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:07.217
The skin cells themselves undergo a lot
of turnover mitotic changes,

c7987939-a4ad-4489-a161-6f94ccdda728-1
00:37:07.217 --> 00:37:12.083
specifically hair follicles,
and therefore during the antigen phase

c7987939-a4ad-4489-a161-6f94ccdda728-2
00:37:12.083 --> 00:37:17.664
they are at risk for DNA damage and
subsequent carcinogenic effect as well as

c7987939-a4ad-4489-a161-6f94ccdda728-3
00:37:17.664 --> 00:37:21.600
immediate deterministic effects of
ionizing radiation.

dd7a8296-5da4-49b4-9f28-285d404b9067-0
00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:26.736
All of those of us interventional
cardiologist that work in the Cath lab

dd7a8296-5da4-49b4-9f28-285d404b9067-1
00:37:26.736 --> 00:37:31.775
have seen the damage done to certain
patients that received more than one to

dd7a8296-5da4-49b4-9f28-285d404b9067-2
00:37:31.775 --> 00:37:36.486
two grades of radiation during a
prolonged interventional procedure and

dd7a8296-5da4-49b4-9f28-285d404b9067-3
00:37:36.486 --> 00:37:41.328
then presenting a month later with a
round patch over their back or their

dd7a8296-5da4-49b4-9f28-285d404b9067-4
00:37:41.328 --> 00:37:45.320
chest where they were exposed to intense
ionizing radiation.

a853d50c-c85a-4232-8377-58dffb139386-0
00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:54.303
The stochastic effects or carcinogenic
effects of ionizing radiation are less

a853d50c-c85a-4232-8377-58dffb139386-1
00:37:54.303 --> 00:37:58.773
understood and one of the questions
that's always asked well,

a853d50c-c85a-4232-8377-58dffb139386-2
00:37:58.773 --> 00:38:00.720
how much radiation is that?

77e5a669-3bf0-47ed-a070-ae56f3e46ed8-0
00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:05.474
How much radiation can one individual
person tolerate before they have

77e5a669-3bf0-47ed-a070-ae56f3e46ed8-1
00:38:05.474 --> 00:38:09.760
significant damage such as a carcinogenic
or stochastic effect?

bb090996-aaa1-425f-b8f0-51232d660d6e-0
00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:12.840
And that remains relatively unclear.

98d92c11-8545-42f9-922e-8013f4859675-0
00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:16.089
However,
studies have now shown that there this is

98d92c11-8545-42f9-922e-8013f4859675-1
00:38:16.089 --> 00:38:20.932
a linear no threshold effect and there
are a number of factors that go into

98d92c11-8545-42f9-922e-8013f4859675-2
00:38:20.932 --> 00:38:23.800
whether someone suffers A stochastic
effect.

bc095d2a-60df-47b7-bb31-f355fb5eccac-0
00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:27.387
It can be age,
younger people are more sensitive to

bc095d2a-60df-47b7-bb31-f355fb5eccac-1
00:38:27.387 --> 00:38:28.000
radiation.

f8fa631f-c65f-437b-8053-798b9c45f8c7-0
00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:29.800
It can be sex.

6acae768-ecde-470a-b665-82f6deac1e3b-0
00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:31.760
Males are more affected.

c0d2c993-3538-45e6-b3ac-34924830bb42-0
00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.360
There seems to be a protective effect of
estrogen.

6e6acd08-c397-4103-95f8-44827973081e-0
00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:39.454
There can be genetic factors,
and there can also be race factors,

6e6acd08-c397-4103-95f8-44827973081e-1
00:38:39.454 --> 00:38:44.000
Caucasian specifically,
or more sensitive to ionizing radiation.

cf8834ae-ee78-4977-9418-734af65a6b1e-0
00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:48.720
So the stochastic effects have a linear
NO threshold.

2b8570d8-270b-45d7-8505-ca77d5aa4d22-0
00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:53.637
That means there's an effect at a very
low dose of ionizing radiation,

2b8570d8-270b-45d7-8505-ca77d5aa4d22-1
00:38:53.637 --> 00:38:57.687
and as the dose increases,
the effect is greater and greater,

2b8570d8-270b-45d7-8505-ca77d5aa4d22-2
00:38:57.687 --> 00:39:01.280
and the risk therefore is greater in a
linear fashion.

890f4dd0-7818-4d8d-bed5-0d35cb6116d7-0
00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:10.249
So now we understand that there is other
issues besides just a deterministic

890f4dd0-7818-4d8d-bed5-0d35cb6116d7-1
00:39:10.249 --> 00:39:15.640
effect or a stochastic effect to those
exposed to ionizing radiation.

afa3b5a6-5ec4-46fb-9e0d-bf040684de5e-0
00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:19.360
It is more complicated than simply
deterministic or stochastic.

88632b96-5123-41e0-a9de-e1a30494fa16-0
00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:23.302
There is new information,
as I said earlier,

88632b96-5123-41e0-a9de-e1a30494fa16-1
00:39:23.302 --> 00:39:27.495
merging evidence that shows there is
effects on the vasculature,

88632b96-5123-41e0-a9de-e1a30494fa16-2
00:39:27.495 --> 00:39:31.560
their effects on the brain,
their effects as well on the skin.

2ef6953f-61ed-45c9-90df-c44fd1ef398d-0
00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:40.139
This is modified or changes occur not
only from direct effects and release of

2ef6953f-61ed-45c9-90df-c44fd1ef398d-1
00:39:40.139 --> 00:39:46.041
free radicals, reactive oxygen species,
but also what's called the bystander

2ef6953f-61ed-45c9-90df-c44fd1ef398d-2
00:39:46.041 --> 00:39:49.797
effect,
where when 1 area of the body is exposed

2ef6953f-61ed-45c9-90df-c44fd1ef398d-3
00:39:49.797 --> 00:39:54.626
to ionizing radiation,
it can affect another area that was not

2ef6953f-61ed-45c9-90df-c44fd1ef398d-4
00:39:54.626 --> 00:39:55.240
exposed.

ef0f88cc-1fcf-4793-a2b4-add67e9bcaaf-0
00:39:58.040 --> 00:39:58.160
Well.

b7c55c39-757b-442d-ad36-e7b2a9bab216-0
00:39:58.160 --> 00:39:58.840
How does that work?

a4c2b3b7-cf90-4611-91aa-4ec3c5ace21c-0
00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:01.917
Well,
if you have a cell such as a skin cell,

a4c2b3b7-cf90-4611-91aa-4ec3c5ace21c-1
00:40:01.917 --> 00:40:03.560
follicular hair follicle cell.

2bffa658-6362-44ef-91b3-5dbfbd11b329-0
00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:08.248
This exposed to ionizing radiation of
whatever form, gamma, beta, alpha,

2bffa658-6362-44ef-91b3-5dbfbd11b329-1
00:40:08.248 --> 00:40:08.920
you name it.

bd4ca773-5956-4666-ad10-9fe2caa79ded-0
00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:15.725
That cell which is a cell undergoing
mitosis and dividing during the antigen

bd4ca773-5956-4666-ad10-9fe2caa79ded-1
00:40:15.725 --> 00:40:21.610
phase is very sensitive to ionizing
radiation and DNA damage can occur which

bd4ca773-5956-4666-ad10-9fe2caa79ded-2
00:40:21.610 --> 00:40:26.120
mutates the cell and it leads to this
carcinogenic effect.

9274c037-7295-46fa-8620-bc46bceb86ca-0
00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:31.258
So timing is of the essence here and
that's why it's important as it relates

9274c037-7295-46fa-8620-bc46bceb86ca-1
00:40:31.258 --> 00:40:35.836
to the skin because of the rapid turnover
of hair follicle cells and is also

9274c037-7295-46fa-8620-bc46bceb86ca-2
00:40:35.836 --> 00:40:39.880
important for the eye because of the
epithelial cells in the limbs.

eb21ddba-e555-4237-8c99-9414fc74abf7-0
00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:45.816
So timing is also a factor as when
someone would get a negative effect from

eb21ddba-e555-4237-8c99-9414fc74abf7-1
00:40:45.816 --> 00:40:47.240
ionizing radiation.

3d4d4379-763f-4114-8a8b-f164b58117a6-0
00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:53.120
There's also vascular effects.

06e744cc-e26e-4526-8ed2-a0975b63a7d7-0
00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:55.800
And I said earlier that there's emerging
evidence.

d6d60e8a-78fe-4ed0-ad04-729a4ab61f42-0
00:40:55.960 --> 00:41:02.482
We know that the endothelium of vascular
vessels is very radiation sensitive and

d6d60e8a-78fe-4ed0-ad04-729a4ab61f42-1
00:41:02.482 --> 00:41:08.120
vulnerable to ionizing radiation because
it's rapid turnover as well.

1bd3d22c-283b-4e3c-94b6-17d987a6c1ee-0
00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:12.034
Oxygen,
reactive oxygen species or otherwise

1bd3d22c-283b-4e3c-94b6-17d987a6c1ee-1
00:41:12.034 --> 00:41:15.960
known as free radicals are released by
ionizing radiation.

d8fd8294-0abf-4f18-a883-68973e53a83f-0
00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:22.155
This effects mood, muscle contractility,
the permeability, the function of cells,

d8fd8294-0abf-4f18-a883-68973e53a83f-1
00:41:22.155 --> 00:41:26.819
vascular tone, blunted basal dilatation,
endothelial dysfunction,

d8fd8294-0abf-4f18-a883-68973e53a83f-2
00:41:26.819 --> 00:41:30.141
which as we all know leads to
atherosclerosis,

d8fd8294-0abf-4f18-a883-68973e53a83f-3
00:41:30.141 --> 00:41:34.239
and other risk factors that cause
cardiovascular disease.

a604c6fd-d45a-47a2-a56e-ab6a315ba9a2-0
00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:40.861
Ionizing radiation,
the vascular vasculature,

a604c6fd-d45a-47a2-a56e-ab6a315ba9a2-1
00:41:40.861 --> 00:41:45.080
causes increase of reactive oxygen
species or free radicals.

b6e7839f-2d7d-4632-bd78-543d2d15212b-0
00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:49.238
These free radicals have all of these
negative effects,

b6e7839f-2d7d-4632-bd78-543d2d15212b-1
00:41:49.238 --> 00:41:53.968
all of which we all know has been well
worked out and determined from a

b6e7839f-2d7d-4632-bd78-543d2d15212b-2
00:41:53.968 --> 00:41:57.713
biochemical aspect,
leads to unopposed vasoconstriction,

b6e7839f-2d7d-4632-bd78-543d2d15212b-3
00:41:57.713 --> 00:42:01.917
leads to inflammation,
all of which leads to increased arterial

b6e7839f-2d7d-4632-bd78-543d2d15212b-4
00:42:01.917 --> 00:42:04.479
wall hypertenicity and atherosclerosis.

c2f55bcb-b4ee-4432-a136-9fc6a4ba19bb-0
00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:11.320
What is well known is the effects on the
eye.

9a3fd2b9-fbc3-4be5-be1c-888bb90b5e9c-0
00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:15.627
The lens,
which is made-up of lens epithelial cells,

9a3fd2b9-fbc3-4be5-be1c-888bb90b5e9c-1
00:42:15.627 --> 00:42:22.009
is very radiation sensitive and there are
a number of studies beginning in the late

9a3fd2b9-fbc3-4be5-be1c-888bb90b5e9c-2
00:42:22.009 --> 00:42:26.872
1800s that have shown that gamma
radiation can cause cataracts,

9a3fd2b9-fbc3-4be5-be1c-888bb90b5e9c-3
00:42:26.872 --> 00:42:29.760
specifically posterior lens cataracts.

5b93b1d9-462a-4ed5-b0b7-46934ad7791f-0
00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:35.417
In most individuals that develop
cataracts as it relates to age and UV

5b93b1d9-462a-4ed5-b0b7-46934ad7791f-1
00:42:35.417 --> 00:42:38.880
radiation,
those are usually anterior cataracts.

03016d89-2212-4522-9ef4-e1c31b5225f9-0
00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:42.491
But when individuals are exposed to
ionizing radiation,

03016d89-2212-4522-9ef4-e1c31b5225f9-1
00:42:42.491 --> 00:42:46.963
the posterior portion of the lens is more
sensitive and it has to do with the

03016d89-2212-4522-9ef4-e1c31b5225f9-2
00:42:46.963 --> 00:42:47.480
turnover.

faa5aefe-f562-4b9d-bc6e-766c3ccf40fd-0
00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:53.405
And we've seen this in number of studies
with interventional cardiologists at the

faa5aefe-f562-4b9d-bc6e-766c3ccf40fd-1
00:42:53.405 --> 00:42:58.699
risk of posterior lens cataracts is
almost 33 1/2% and the overall risk is 6.

faa5aefe-f562-4b9d-bc6e-766c3ccf40fd-2
00:42:58.699 --> 00:43:00.600
8, which is relatively high.

9bb8896f-fd7b-4bd3-8679-0f984b76b46d-0
00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:06.135
So certainly eye protection is well
needed and those individuals that are

9bb8896f-fd7b-4bd3-8679-0f984b76b46d-1
00:43:06.135 --> 00:43:10.438
exposed to ionizing radiation, the lens,
like I said earlier,

9bb8896f-fd7b-4bd3-8679-0f984b76b46d-2
00:43:10.438 --> 00:43:15.921
the lens epithelial cells when exposed to
ionizing radiation cause a number of

9bb8896f-fd7b-4bd3-8679-0f984b76b46d-3
00:43:15.921 --> 00:43:19.669
things occur, incomplete differentiation,
activation,

9bb8896f-fd7b-4bd3-8679-0f984b76b46d-4
00:43:19.669 --> 00:43:21.960
cell death and then carcinogenic.

bb8fed82-8f61-4b6e-bd9d-ce45620ee011-0
00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:27.645
And this can be both with a threshold but
also without a threshold,

bb8fed82-8f61-4b6e-bd9d-ce45620ee011-1
00:43:27.645 --> 00:43:31.160
meaning that it's not just a threshold
effect.

3149f9bc-a6b8-4b00-a07d-ab21200e4477-0
00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:35.480
It can occur at any dose of ionizing
radiation.

839f0724-95ff-441d-b6ee-99b2b87ad4b5-0
00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:45.121
In addition to the effects on the skin
and the eye and the circulatory system,

839f0724-95ff-441d-b6ee-99b2b87ad4b5-1
00:43:45.121 --> 00:43:49.040
ionizing radiation induces an
inflammatory response.

88356d0c-fc01-4c6f-975a-22a9e0679540-0
00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:55.145
We have a number of studies that have
shown that even low dose radiation less

88356d0c-fc01-4c6f-975a-22a9e0679540-1
00:43:55.145 --> 00:43:58.829
than .
5 grey exposure induces damage to T cell

88356d0c-fc01-4c6f-975a-22a9e0679540-2
00:43:58.829 --> 00:43:59.520
immunity.

372da5b4-d9e4-4562-b82f-6b3bff75a941-0
00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:06.690
There's a dichotomy of responses as it
relates to the dose of ionizing radiation,

372da5b4-d9e4-4562-b82f-6b3bff75a941-1
00:44:06.690 --> 00:44:11.898
which is very interesting because at low
dosage you see a more of a pro

372da5b4-d9e4-4562-b82f-6b3bff75a941-2
00:44:11.898 --> 00:44:16.600
inflammatory immune profile with damages
to the T cell immunity.

a694ecf5-b199-4359-b494-6b0eb34ed76c-0
00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:21.156
But at moderate doses,
you see an anti-inflammatory effect where

a694ecf5-b199-4359-b494-6b0eb34ed76c-1
00:44:21.156 --> 00:44:25.761
you can treat patients that have
inflammation with moderate dosages and

a694ecf5-b199-4359-b494-6b0eb34ed76c-2
00:44:25.761 --> 00:44:27.359
reduce that inflammation.

92cab473-6793-482f-9960-5397735e8d56-0
00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:33.465
However,
when you look at these studies as studies

92cab473-6793-482f-9960-5397735e8d56-1
00:44:33.465 --> 00:44:38.915
of individuals and this is cohorts and
also the mirroring or mouse models,

92cab473-6793-482f-9960-5397735e8d56-2
00:44:38.915 --> 00:44:44.292
you can see at the low dose how it
affects and inhibits the immune system

92cab473-6793-482f-9960-5397735e8d56-3
00:44:44.292 --> 00:44:46.400
and direct effect on T cells.

1764b762-241a-4776-9d8b-e4d03312053f-0
00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:50.117
At an intermediate dose that is between .
1 and 1,

1764b762-241a-4776-9d8b-e4d03312053f-1
00:44:50.117 --> 00:44:53.240
Gray radiation has an anti-inflammatory
effect.

c3c67850-54ec-4150-891a-9bdafd5e4066-0
00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:55.280
It can improve patients that have
inflammation.

94e7e3dc-860a-4a7e-b39c-694752c1be09-0
00:44:55.640 --> 00:45:01.137
But when you move to a high dose,
you have severe damage to the immune

94e7e3dc-860a-4a7e-b39c-694752c1be09-1
00:45:01.137 --> 00:45:06.557
system, immune suppression,
a pro inflammatory response and release a

94e7e3dc-860a-4a7e-b39c-694752c1be09-2
00:45:06.557 --> 00:45:12.520
very dangerous signals that induce
carcinogenesis, that induce inflammation.

cfaf507f-3eaa-42d1-a867-40e3269df244-0
00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:17.640
And then from there the bystander effect
takes over and more damage is done

cfaf507f-3eaa-42d1-a867-40e3269df244-1
00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:19.160
throughout the human body.

27fc0574-bacf-416d-9235-43eadde75511-0
00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:25.840
With that,
I'll stop there and take questions.

5226640e-e13f-4dea-aafa-423b81e96b7f-0
00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:37.803
Hello, everyone, and,
and welcome back to to this great session

5226640e-e13f-4dea-aafa-423b81e96b7f-1
00:45:37.803 --> 00:45:39.080
that we just had.

1c7fac8d-aea7-498f-88ac-c951d7b2a6c8-0
00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:44.094
This is a question and answer session and
I do hope that you would send in your

1c7fac8d-aea7-498f-88ac-c951d7b2a6c8-1
00:45:44.094 --> 00:45:45.320
questions and answers.

b69a414c-aa42-46bf-a494-e51be4d92dae-0
00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:49.867
Hopefully we'll get those answers here to
this panel of experts and or we'll answer

b69a414c-aa42-46bf-a494-e51be4d92dae-1
00:45:49.867 --> 00:45:51.600
them offline kind of in between.

f043cb6d-0c9f-47fd-95f0-967b210df18b-0
00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:54.560
But but I promise you we'll get those,
we'll get those answers.

85812bd0-de90-4e39-8cf1-3185feed70ef-0
00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:58.680
Joined by Bella Housing,
the Co director of SERP this year.

7ff94c3b-4b5f-4859-b846-cee1a4291d26-0
00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.440
And and really looking forward to this.

939cb9e2-0d96-4752-a2a0-45ce68dc26c8-0
00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:04.258
I learned, you know,
I think out of this session,

939cb9e2-0d96-4752-a2a0-45ce68dc26c8-1
00:46:04.258 --> 00:46:08.880
I probably will learn the most because I
have so, so much to learn in this field.

9cb17bc4-199f-46ae-a360-d5348c105ba6-0
00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:12.262
But but we're joined by Doctor Karen
Murphy,

9cb17bc4-199f-46ae-a360-d5348c105ba6-1
00:46:12.262 --> 00:46:15.760
professor of interventional
neuroradiology in Toronto.

a282fa27-436c-4110-aeac-70d24e50c9cc-0
00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:21.862
We have Doctor Lauren Ramsey from she's a
medical director of breast surgery

a282fa27-436c-4110-aeac-70d24e50c9cc-1
00:46:21.862 --> 00:46:23.480
welcome at Fort Worth.

c478b09d-6182-482c-a0ea-59063b39f847-0
00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:28.633
And then Doctor Tom Egan here,
president of Cardiovascular Associates in

c478b09d-6182-482c-a0ea-59063b39f847-1
00:46:28.633 --> 00:46:32.208
Birmingham,
AL And so got a great team here and I can

c478b09d-6182-482c-a0ea-59063b39f847-2
00:46:32.208 --> 00:46:33.399
kind of start off.

c54cf2b6-ab56-4684-889b-e6412454a434-0
00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:40.160
I'd love to ask Doctor Murphy,
just a question about, about that testing.

dc8f2865-0759-4b15-92b3-3392bfae01dd-0
00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:44.376
I was fascinated when you talked about
our risk and everybody's risks are

dc8f2865-0759-4b15-92b3-3392bfae01dd-1
00:46:44.376 --> 00:46:48.764
different to exposure, this radiation and,
and all the things that you could

dc8f2865-0759-4b15-92b3-3392bfae01dd-2
00:46:48.764 --> 00:46:52.640
possibly test to see if you're more
susceptible to the next person.

d2daccdc-0c0c-4f1c-a466-39b76a32b053-0
00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:55.990
I know at least in cardiology,
we have people afraid to get calcium

d2daccdc-0c0c-4f1c-a466-39b76a32b053-1
00:46:55.990 --> 00:46:58.946
scores because they don't really want to
know if they have,

d2daccdc-0c0c-4f1c-a466-39b76a32b053-2
00:46:58.946 --> 00:47:03.035
if they have coronary disease and they're
afraid that life insurance is then going

d2daccdc-0c0c-4f1c-a466-39b76a32b053-3
00:47:03.035 --> 00:47:04.760
to be affected and everything else.

a0cf7574-87a1-465f-8cca-5dfa014ea1e6-0
00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:08.951
And so how do we have that conversation
and, and, and,

a0cf7574-87a1-465f-8cca-5dfa014ea1e6-1
00:47:08.951 --> 00:47:14.553
and before we kind of start that process
of seeing who is really truly susceptible

a0cf7574-87a1-465f-8cca-5dfa014ea1e6-2
00:47:14.553 --> 00:47:19.952
and who should maybe take another line of
work question, it's an ethical issue,

a0cf7574-87a1-465f-8cca-5dfa014ea1e6-3
00:47:19.952 --> 00:47:20.560
isn't it?

3a074690-ed78-422f-b0e0-b1da8821be18-0
00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:22.360
It has to be handled compassionately.

85ae25e5-747e-451a-b010-f41e482ff110-0
00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:29.040
But I think first thing would be just
some insight into the fact that we're not

85ae25e5-747e-451a-b010-f41e482ff110-1
00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:30.880
all equally backed by radiation.

f753aea5-5a4f-4eb3-b72d-e4a27840d60b-0
00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:37.432
And then look at family history,
the if your mom or aunts at BRCA,

f753aea5-5a4f-4eb3-b72d-e4a27840d60b-1
00:47:37.432 --> 00:47:43.735
one or two breast cancer that might make
you look for a, or you know,

f753aea5-5a4f-4eb3-b72d-e4a27840d60b-2
00:47:43.735 --> 00:47:49.498
if there was some other range lineage of
things, obviously the,

f753aea5-5a4f-4eb3-b72d-e4a27840d60b-3
00:47:49.498 --> 00:47:52.560
the MEN syndromes would stand out.

a8e018be-4819-4f13-95b1-ba7084b26518-0
00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:59.939
But then we could take some peripheral
blood other than the solar radiator,

a8e018be-4819-4f13-95b1-ba7084b26518-1
00:47:59.939 --> 00:48:06.131
expose it to a standard amount of
radiation and in a controlled way,

a8e018be-4819-4f13-95b1-ba7084b26518-2
00:48:06.131 --> 00:48:13.220
look for the amount of innate damage you
get in the nucleus or mitochondria by

a8e018be-4819-4f13-95b1-ba7084b26518-3
00:48:13.220 --> 00:48:20.039
doing common assay or 50 or gamma H2 IX
and, and get an estimate from that.

a5c482cd-5a4f-4ade-a113-4fedcc43c42d-0
00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:22.920
And it'll be arranged.

bb4d4ccb-252e-466d-8a7d-d0de46d9acad-0
00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:28.847
Probably it'll depend on nutrition,
it'll depend on antioxidant intake,

bb4d4ccb-252e-466d-8a7d-d0de46d9acad-1
00:48:28.847 --> 00:48:31.400
but something simple like that.

cfc460e3-5ad5-4e76-8abe-fe9fcc654bfe-0
00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:37.530
But I think it begins with a conversation
and then the right ethical principle,

cfc460e3-5ad5-4e76-8abe-fe9fcc654bfe-1
00:48:37.530 --> 00:48:39.600
genetic counseling context.

ddbc3682-cc73-4b82-8a3c-0d9e6f98e561-0
00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:43.000
Great.

38e00eed-c293-4689-9925-789f2688b456-0
00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:46.485
I had,
I did want to tell a little story that I

38e00eed-c293-4689-9925-789f2688b456-1
00:48:46.485 --> 00:48:50.243
actually heard this week,
and I want to direct this at you,

38e00eed-c293-4689-9925-789f2688b456-2
00:48:50.243 --> 00:48:51.119
Doctor Ramsey.

c1977b25-8e1d-4806-99d1-ad362fe3493a-0
00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:56.131
There was a friend of mine whose fiance
is an orthopedic resident,

c1977b25-8e1d-4806-99d1-ad362fe3493a-1
00:48:56.131 --> 00:48:59.263
and she just started her residency
program and,

c1977b25-8e1d-4806-99d1-ad362fe3493a-2
00:48:59.263 --> 00:49:03.961
and I won't name the facility,
but she started that and she said, yeah,

c1977b25-8e1d-4806-99d1-ad362fe3493a-3
00:49:03.961 --> 00:49:09.181
but they're not going to buy her a lead
apron until her third year of residency

c1977b25-8e1d-4806-99d1-ad362fe3493a-4
00:49:09.181 --> 00:49:10.160
in orthopedics.

73522374-cefb-44d9-972b-81ba5b7885d8-0
00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:13.147
And until then,
she just has to either find someone

73522374-cefb-44d9-972b-81ba5b7885d8-1
00:49:13.147 --> 00:49:15.560
else's or stand behind somebody in the OR.

5370a45a-5f63-425f-8e2a-f08a18547285-0
00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:17.400
So I think that's what we're dealing with.

e677d688-4b1e-4d31-8557-20f48ad5310a-0
00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:21.184
You know,
the people I'm not sure really care about

e677d688-4b1e-4d31-8557-20f48ad5310a-1
00:49:21.184 --> 00:49:21.840
about us.

0bb546c3-5f5d-4ccc-9cba-1526387d6817-0
00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:26.478
And I think to this point, you know,
we've been kind of cavalier about not

0bb546c3-5f5d-4ccc-9cba-1526387d6817-1
00:49:26.478 --> 00:49:27.520
caring for ourselves.

181924b0-c3dc-406f-a984-ba40a6cd377b-0
00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:30.798
But but, you know,
it's time that we get the protection we

181924b0-c3dc-406f-a984-ba40a6cd377b-1
00:49:30.798 --> 00:49:34.710
need if we're going to be put in those
situations where we're exposed to have

181924b0-c3dc-406f-a984-ba40a6cd377b-2
00:49:34.710 --> 00:49:37.720
the right equipment and garments and
coverage that we need.

cf1a10a3-3e9d-41cc-aa8e-8ba3ab8c47d6-0
00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:39.240
Thoughts on that?

71cc2860-7503-4fbf-8ad8-ff33de5ae0fb-0
00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:40.960
Yeah, absolutely.

da3e4dd6-7eb6-4410-ad80-06c9db53b238-0
00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:44.312
I mean,
that was my experience as a surgery

da3e4dd6-7eb6-4410-ad80-06c9db53b238-1
00:49:44.312 --> 00:49:50.411
resident and I was in general surgery,
so I was never provided with my own apron

da3e4dd6-7eb6-4410-ad80-06c9db53b238-2
00:49:50.411 --> 00:49:51.240
or grenade.

fc4b0b20-35a3-46aa-b090-9bb956cdfcef-0
00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:55.406
I use fluoroscopy a lot less than
orthopedic surgeon,

fc4b0b20-35a3-46aa-b090-9bb956cdfcef-1
00:49:55.406 --> 00:50:01.656
but that was my whole inspiration behind
creating the bat and thinking about how

fc4b0b20-35a3-46aa-b090-9bb956cdfcef-2
00:50:01.656 --> 00:50:05.360
women really need to be protected and
also men.

6e267ddc-92f9-4484-a820-ba09887e00ff-0
00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:11.960
So unfortunately it has been hard to get
institutions and programs to care.

858ca76e-9347-4496-b752-cc893d47047f-0
00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:15.515
And if I could change one thing,
I wish that that would be it,

858ca76e-9347-4496-b752-cc893d47047f-1
00:50:15.515 --> 00:50:18.200
that we were provided with appropriate
protection.

618556d2-3c3d-4b1a-aab3-3a97f8e4913b-0
00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:20.400
But I think the culture is changing.

923d0d11-47fa-4c5e-8e24-fe5b6b17b0a3-0
00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:25.629
I saw a recent meta analysis about the
increased risk of cancer and healthcare

923d0d11-47fa-4c5e-8e24-fe5b6b17b0a3-1
00:50:25.629 --> 00:50:27.880
providers who work with radiation.

83326476-5148-46a8-8a0a-4250c2540ae0-0
00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:31.767
So I think as like those numbers are
starting to come out and we're starting

83326476-5148-46a8-8a0a-4250c2540ae0-1
00:50:31.767 --> 00:50:33.080
to get the word out there.

92bad232-cd31-4946-9975-5d6e1bfee967-0
00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:37.560
I've been trying to advocate for this on
social media with different physicians.

0fe600fe-1624-418f-8bb5-7b9f5137cea0-0
00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:41.394
That's what it's going to take to,
you know,

0fe600fe-1624-418f-8bb5-7b9f5137cea0-1
00:50:41.394 --> 00:50:45.040
like have hospitals actually change their
policies.

65fe3e7f-9636-415a-83a9-0944cf3ba16a-0
00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:49.120
Good, Bella.

aec9fb0f-e0c0-4d4f-8ed2-ccc15888f48f-0
00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:52.268
I don't want to, again,
I don't want to take all the questions if

aec9fb0f-e0c0-4d4f-8ed2-ccc15888f48f-1
00:50:52.268 --> 00:50:54.200
you want to ask, if you want to ask them.

09fa1819-c132-483f-8807-d5fea5ac8c69-0
00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:55.080
And I've got a few more too.

49cb9a4e-8173-43a3-816e-27d87be77c94-0
00:50:56.120 --> 00:50:56.360
Yeah.

fe72f1fd-06e2-448d-aee7-7ddb5c635ac5-0
00:50:56.360 --> 00:50:59.920
So my first is, is more of a comment.

4f94d4d4-75e1-4bcb-93d6-747d61f3665d-0
00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:03.480
It's just to say that obviously these
talks are super powerful.

bddc7f92-ab3c-4c15-a717-c4c135e142da-0
00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:07.019
And if there are younger generations
sitting watching this,

bddc7f92-ab3c-4c15-a717-c4c135e142da-1
00:51:07.019 --> 00:51:11.679
the the point is not to scare and it's
not the point for me personally anyway,

bddc7f92-ab3c-4c15-a717-c4c135e142da-2
00:51:11.679 --> 00:51:15.572
it's not to deviate you away from this
career is to actually say,

bddc7f92-ab3c-4c15-a717-c4c135e142da-3
00:51:15.572 --> 00:51:20.468
these are the problems and we're going to
throw out this virtual online courses to

bddc7f92-ab3c-4c15-a717-c4c135e142da-4
00:51:20.468 --> 00:51:22.120
also tell you the solutions.

1e40ce7f-6a33-4ef7-9634-8d1247a6d304-0
00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:25.452
So it's important to bear that in mind
and not to be frightened,

1e40ce7f-6a33-4ef7-9634-8d1247a6d304-1
00:51:25.452 --> 00:51:28.640
not to go and think, OK,
this is absolutely not the career for me.

78351f39-86d9-4e66-a158-d565351f4ae1-0
00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:30.160
Absolutely not.

9c73f0c2-4924-4310-a2f4-3426ac273342-0
00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:33.221
The point is,
is that we have solutions now that we

9c73f0c2-4924-4310-a2f4-3426ac273342-1
00:51:33.221 --> 00:51:36.964
didn't know about before and we didn't
even really fully understand or

9c73f0c2-4924-4310-a2f4-3426ac273342-2
00:51:36.964 --> 00:51:39.600
appreciate the problems that we're facing
anyway.

725883d8-f2c8-4453-b44c-759bab09c522-0
00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:42.520
So these are the two things and to marry
the two together.

53dbafde-4b13-48f1-8e38-0136bf1d4b0f-0
00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:45.000
So it's not to create panic and not to
create worry.

1d2d6177-b2cc-416a-9ca8-355615b76b29-0
00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:50.238
My question really for anybody from the
panel moving forward, I mean,

1d2d6177-b2cc-416a-9ca8-355615b76b29-1
00:51:50.238 --> 00:51:54.607
I am flabbergasted that anybody would
ever ask a trainee to go into a room

1d2d6177-b2cc-416a-9ca8-355615b76b29-2
00:51:54.607 --> 00:51:58.336
without like this is you don't want to
remember saying to Andy,

1d2d6177-b2cc-416a-9ca8-355615b76b29-3
00:51:58.336 --> 00:51:59.560
should we have rules?

c70cd825-3399-4dfc-8cec-e37f38f5e9b0-0
00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:00.920
Should we have laws?

9ee86dce-42a6-4084-baf5-319c0689a915-0
00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:02.960
This would be one of them.

30b886d1-7240-4595-b915-bf31c93cd938-0
00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:04.720
That's just to scare.

f8a58569-c6d3-4f37-bdce-4d723fea2611-0
00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:09.480
But what do you think we we can do about
this?

600cb20f-facb-4b22-b399-981889aac3f4-0
00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:14.636
I mean, just listening to talk,
my first thought is we have to rampart

600cb20f-facb-4b22-b399-981889aac3f4-1
00:52:14.636 --> 00:52:19.582
the whole place out because that would be
the first solution, you know,

600cb20f-facb-4b22-b399-981889aac3f4-2
00:52:19.582 --> 00:52:25.283
to just try and stop as much scatter from
getting anywhere until we discover fully

600cb20f-facb-4b22-b399-981889aac3f4-3
00:52:25.283 --> 00:52:29.680
which areas are really more, you know,
problematic than others.

48b0d9dd-cfe8-456d-8ac8-430aec415296-0
00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:32.192
But for you guys and fam, what,
what would you,

48b0d9dd-cfe8-456d-8ac8-430aec415296-1
00:52:32.192 --> 00:52:33.680
what would be your take on this?

dca0c811-f5cb-4f3b-90f5-afa3228bac54-0
00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:39.847
What would be the first line of action,
Something that I wish my institution had

dca0c811-f5cb-4f3b-90f5-afa3228bac54-1
00:52:39.847 --> 00:52:46.167
was do seminars where we can actually see
the readings instead of having to submit

dca0c811-f5cb-4f3b-90f5-afa3228bac54-2
00:52:46.167 --> 00:52:52.258
and for waiting a month until we get the
report just because I feel like by the

dca0c811-f5cb-4f3b-90f5-afa3228bac54-3
00:52:52.258 --> 00:52:55.000
time we get the data, it's too late.

469be8a1-2df8-4804-a402-a0ef93074371-0
00:52:55.160 --> 00:53:00.229
So I wish that that was something that
more institutions would adopt or you kind

469be8a1-2df8-4804-a402-a0ef93074371-1
00:53:00.229 --> 00:53:04.360
of get a more more up to date reflection
of your actual exposure.

ecaa2925-53ae-40b0-9120-ff17177c9beb-0
00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:10.193
Yeah,
I think that would be perfect as well,

ecaa2925-53ae-40b0-9120-ff17177c9beb-1
00:53:10.193 --> 00:53:11.800
especially for female pregnant staff.

8168b3b3-a0e9-4996-af97-56ab655043f1-0
00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:13.720
That'd be great.

53d18245-72ae-4bbf-a581-bca72cde6487-0
00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:19.604
Other guys,
could I just say that I discovered in our

53d18245-72ae-4bbf-a581-bca72cde6487-1
00:53:19.604 --> 00:53:25.000
facility that the Angel Suites doesn't go
all the way to the scene.

1f6539fc-7b9e-4647-b75a-0cf8a1aefe15-0
00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:30.920
It's actually only gets about two feet in
the ceiling and stops.

324c6406-b384-4240-8993-272c26c68f38-0
00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:38.490
So our room is not really landline,
it's just are you asleep spy intervention

324c6406-b384-4240-8993-272c26c68f38-1
00:53:38.490 --> 00:53:43.840
and stunningly though,
it doesn't go all the way to the roof.

085e8233-a9d2-4b31-a2b0-270166788f53-0
00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:48.021
But when you're sitting in the control
room and you think no lad, we're safe,

085e8233-a9d2-4b31-a2b0-270166788f53-1
00:53:48.021 --> 00:53:48.600
it's all good.

064bec02-4029-48ec-8d23-649a85e2d9c9-0
00:53:49.160 --> 00:53:51.320
The fact scatter coming into the room.

86bab799-5851-4483-b3d4-08be7f2cb13e-0
00:53:51.720 --> 00:53:55.352
The thing is,
I had great fun with my ideology

86bab799-5851-4483-b3d4-08be7f2cb13e-1
00:53:55.352 --> 00:53:57.440
residents doing this study.

6e6d5c7e-51ad-4298-bfd9-dd33abf1a43d-0
00:53:58.120 --> 00:54:03.560
I got really expensive high tech study,
bought instant lead tests on Amazon.

f278fbc8-6f1b-4ad9-a145-f635e6a9c61f-0
00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:10.720
There are lead aprons to look for free
lead dust on the surface of the aprons

f278fbc8-6f1b-4ad9-a145-f635e6a9c61f-1
00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:16.600
and 63% of them have free dust come
across free dust doesn't think those red.

2c037250-1c2b-4fe3-8006-651dc59e887f-0
00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:20.080
So that's also bad.

af5bfc8a-8cd0-4544-bd8c-0f1d5197e64a-0
00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:23.126
And if you some other folks have the same
thing,

af5bfc8a-8cd0-4544-bd8c-0f1d5197e64a-1
00:54:23.126 --> 00:54:26.920
they'd be measuring lead level in the
hair of technologists.

0ca13bf0-2e1e-4148-b341-c20fa6d1a26c-0
00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:34.094
There's that in the hair of the
technologies out of the ultrasound text,

0ca13bf0-2e1e-4148-b341-c20fa6d1a26c-1
00:54:34.094 --> 00:54:39.086
that's the future text,
but the dust is getting on their finger

0ca13bf0-2e1e-4148-b341-c20fa6d1a26c-2
00:54:39.086 --> 00:54:40.880
or whatever getting it.

c8c40b7d-de2d-4334-bb13-1146d5405c20-0
00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:43.240
It's not safe level of life.

77eb8ec8-1ece-4bac-98cc-94c1f9674dc8-0
00:54:43.240 --> 00:54:50.448
People are little things that indicate
that we really have application has to be

77eb8ec8-1ece-4bac-98cc-94c1f9674dc8-1
00:54:50.448 --> 00:54:58.012
like radiation workers, the nuclear power,
not like the people working with asbestos

77eb8ec8-1ece-4bac-98cc-94c1f9674dc8-2
00:54:58.012 --> 00:54:59.080
responsible.

2c7ecbdb-5508-42a9-aaed-70111782805a-0
00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:01.680
That's the whole show.

1c74e061-d68b-43b8-a91e-636ac7a16bd1-0
00:55:04.360 --> 00:55:05.640
Yeah, I agree.

d57b0cc5-c847-4e80-bf1b-42b4d970af4d-0
00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:10.159
I think that, you know,
we've got a long way to go in these labs

d57b0cc5-c847-4e80-bf1b-42b4d970af4d-1
00:55:10.159 --> 00:55:15.443
to get them up to speed on on providing a
safe environment for us to be in,

d57b0cc5-c847-4e80-bf1b-42b4d970af4d-2
00:55:15.443 --> 00:55:21.074
whether it's maintaining our LED like it
should be, whether it's clean cleaning,

d57b0cc5-c847-4e80-bf1b-42b4d970af4d-3
00:55:21.074 --> 00:55:26.080
you know, cleaning our our LED,
whether it is providing the appropriate

d57b0cc5-c847-4e80-bf1b-42b4d970af4d-4
00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:29.974
barrier protection,
whether it's disposable or or large

d57b0cc5-c847-4e80-bf1b-42b4d970af4d-5
00:55:29.974 --> 00:55:30.600
barriers.

a1e66781-7a41-4840-be1e-d4a0d3420363-0
00:55:30.600 --> 00:55:34.700
And it really depends on what you do and
who all's in the room and,

a1e66781-7a41-4840-be1e-d4a0d3420363-1
00:55:34.700 --> 00:55:38.440
and trying to get everyone,
trying to get everyone protected.

39fd81cd-c077-4fa3-b0db-1e5ad06622d0-0
00:55:38.440 --> 00:55:43.106
So looking at at each of these and,
and I think now there are capabilities of

39fd81cd-c077-4fa3-b0db-1e5ad06622d0-1
00:55:43.106 --> 00:55:45.200
really driving those numbers lower.

8ae0ed04-7fc4-48f1-a8f8-ae209ed2d21e-0
00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:47.000
But I think first we have to understand
it.

53a2625f-5b3e-46f2-9171-cc24c9164d41-0
00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:50.932
And like you said, Doctor Ramsey,
I think using some of these real time

53a2625f-5b3e-46f2-9171-cc24c9164d41-1
00:55:50.932 --> 00:55:54.647
disseminary to know what numbers,
what we can do even in the rooms,

53a2625f-5b3e-46f2-9171-cc24c9164d41-2
00:55:54.647 --> 00:55:58.907
because I'm surprised that people don't
know what the effective angles are of

53a2625f-5b3e-46f2-9171-cc24c9164d41-3
00:55:58.907 --> 00:56:02.240
your, of your sea arm and,
and how much that really changed.

80682241-e73b-4795-872e-418fbe1d6a44-0
00:56:02.560 --> 00:56:07.934
And do you really need those steep angles
that often and, and raising the table and,

80682241-e73b-4795-872e-418fbe1d6a44-1
00:56:07.934 --> 00:56:11.474
and, you know,
just small barriers in certain positions

80682241-e73b-4795-872e-418fbe1d6a44-2
00:56:11.474 --> 00:56:14.320
that, you know,
have very high scatter area.

eba746e3-f68f-4652-a3fe-0dcf08a4ea94-0
00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:18.603
So I do think there's a lot of things
that we can do just through really just

eba746e3-f68f-4652-a3fe-0dcf08a4ea94-1
00:56:18.603 --> 00:56:21.240
through education to make,
to make big changes.

00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:25.720
Doctor Eagan, you know, thank,
thanks for joining us.

cebac175-a56a-49a7-9cd1-a3ad6fcc034d-0
00:56:25.720 --> 00:56:30.397
And I know that, that, you know, I've,
I've obviously had my, my issues with my,

cebac175-a56a-49a7-9cd1-a3ad6fcc034d-1
00:56:30.397 --> 00:56:34.093
my back problems and,
and both of us were on the scatter denial

cebac175-a56a-49a7-9cd1-a3ad6fcc034d-2
00:56:34.093 --> 00:56:34.440
video.

6ca4fd12-f7a9-4e32-ba5f-a66e2b451343-0
00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:39.978
And for all the participants who haven't,
haven't seen that scatter denial video

6ca4fd12-f7a9-4e32-ba5f-a66e2b451343-1
00:56:39.978 --> 00:56:44.965
going through the history of radiation
and, and, and, and really how, how it,

6ca4fd12-f7a9-4e32-ba5f-a66e2b451343-2
00:56:44.965 --> 00:56:48.417
it affects you and,
and the different people that it,

6ca4fd12-f7a9-4e32-ba5f-a66e2b451343-3
00:56:48.417 --> 00:56:49.760
that it has affected.

904d28c9-0238-422b-87b4-378d1443cebc-0
00:56:50.680 --> 00:56:54.522
You know, all of us have,
have friends that have, have even had,

904d28c9-0238-422b-87b4-378d1443cebc-1
00:56:54.522 --> 00:56:57.242
you know,
brain cancers and things like that,

904d28c9-0238-422b-87b4-378d1443cebc-2
00:56:57.242 --> 00:57:00.080
and certainly back injuries and other
injuries.

deb12926-c1c6-45d1-b1da-754432f8c626-0
00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:02.499
But,
but as you start seeing your colleagues,

deb12926-c1c6-45d1-b1da-754432f8c626-1
00:57:02.499 --> 00:57:05.182
when you,
when you've been in this business for 20

deb12926-c1c6-45d1-b1da-754432f8c626-2
00:57:05.182 --> 00:57:07.971
or 30 years,
starting to fall out and you see really

deb12926-c1c6-45d1-b1da-754432f8c626-3
00:57:07.971 --> 00:57:10.917
good, talented,
talented people that no longer can work

deb12926-c1c6-45d1-b1da-754432f8c626-4
00:57:10.917 --> 00:57:13.600
and no longer can teach,
it really is devastating.

a5a7e7b8-bbc4-4e35-8a51-684691590b33-0
00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:17.930
So you know what I know, Tom,
you've been here in Birmingham, we,

a5a7e7b8-bbc4-4e35-8a51-684691590b33-1
00:57:17.930 --> 00:57:21.604
we've experienced people that,
that have had those and,

a5a7e7b8-bbc4-4e35-8a51-684691590b33-2
00:57:21.604 --> 00:57:24.360
and how do we get to this next generation?

e7e932cc-aa25-41e1-b2e3-e9e5e8245458-0
00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:28.830
So that, you know,
ideally it shouldn't be reactive like it

e7e932cc-aa25-41e1-b2e3-e9e5e8245458-1
00:57:28.830 --> 00:57:29.040
is.

49ada3de-7612-4ad6-a31b-67b946f27ead-0
00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:33.185
It shouldn't be like,
like some of us who had to come out of

49ada3de-7612-4ad6-a31b-67b946f27ead-1
00:57:33.185 --> 00:57:35.360
the lab because of our injuries.

ffaf0d0c-aa43-4a93-ac7f-5bd51265f8b3-0
00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:38.930
You really need to get to that younger
generation before they,

ffaf0d0c-aa43-4a93-ac7f-5bd51265f8b3-1
00:57:38.930 --> 00:57:40.120
before they get hurt.

6fe0852e-c906-40f6-aabe-3053be3a1d5c-0
00:57:40.120 --> 00:57:41.520
So how do we reach them?

ce9ffde8-dd73-4618-a7cc-7d4a8ba4341c-0
00:57:42.920 --> 00:57:45.520
Well, Bob, first of all,
I agree with Bella.

5da54c9c-ef0d-401f-b698-ab45a98bb32a-0
00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:50.442
I mean, I think we, you know,
fortunately for me and that example of my

5da54c9c-ef0d-401f-b698-ab45a98bb32a-1
00:57:50.442 --> 00:57:54.065
talk that was me,
my case and my case is pretty well

5da54c9c-ef0d-401f-b698-ab45a98bb32a-2
00:57:54.065 --> 00:57:59.192
documented by David Documentary and
better denials what happened to me and

5da54c9c-ef0d-401f-b698-ab45a98bb32a-3
00:57:59.192 --> 00:58:04.319
the hundreds of spin cancers that I
developed on the left side of my body.

bf978ada-b010-454e-8b72-0ce4b080af60-0
00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:09.810
But I came out in cardiology and
interventional cardiology late 80s and

bf978ada-b010-454e-8b72-0ce4b080af60-1
00:58:09.810 --> 00:58:15.472
early 90s once protection was very poor
and the equipment was very poor and there

bf978ada-b010-454e-8b72-0ce4b080af60-2
00:58:15.472 --> 00:58:19.960
was a lot of high doses of radiation that
we use the wrong case.

73727731-0370-4357-b6e3-3f2f9db959a9-0
00:58:19.960 --> 00:58:22.520
It is very limited protection.

831cf277-e5f6-4a1a-ab9b-b4ee68f152b9-0
00:58:22.520 --> 00:58:25.920
So that's unfortunate for us.

97540f27-a63e-477d-9ba4-52e6e50f8b92-0
00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:30.674
The older generation that came out when
this subspecialty was in its infancy and

97540f27-a63e-477d-9ba4-52e6e50f8b92-1
00:58:30.674 --> 00:58:35.429
all we cared about was the patient and
the outcomes and really didn't care about

97540f27-a63e-477d-9ba4-52e6e50f8b92-2
00:58:35.429 --> 00:58:38.540
ourselves,
our own health because it was so exciting

97540f27-a63e-477d-9ba4-52e6e50f8b92-3
00:58:38.540 --> 00:58:41.709
as we saw in that earlier video about
being the hero,

97540f27-a63e-477d-9ba4-52e6e50f8b92-4
00:58:41.709 --> 00:58:45.759
about being able to take care of these
really, really sick patients.

eb2e9d0e-a3fd-4053-b6ee-9828eed2ac29-0
00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:51.377
So I think and the other thing I would
say, Bob, is that, you know,

eb2e9d0e-a3fd-4053-b6ee-9828eed2ac29-1
00:58:51.377 --> 00:58:57.020
when we first started this special of
interventional cardiology got more mature,

eb2e9d0e-a3fd-4053-b6ee-9828eed2ac29-2
00:58:57.020 --> 00:59:01.061
we started to test,
we started to develop a subspecial of

eb2e9d0e-a3fd-4053-b6ee-9828eed2ac29-3
00:59:01.061 --> 00:59:05.520
interventional cardiology,
started to test, certify physicians.

c65cf45a-a4c7-4e5c-ad96-cde6d3a6f3f9-0
00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:12.052
And I remember one of the very first
lectures out of those pre board test

c65cf45a-a4c7-4e5c-ad96-cde6d3a6f3f9-1
00:59:12.052 --> 00:59:18.183
that's that when this was brought up,
there was very little knowledge and it

c65cf45a-a4c7-4e5c-ad96-cde6d3a6f3f9-2
00:59:18.183 --> 00:59:24.235
was good because some small studies,
basically phone call studies show that

c65cf45a-a4c7-4e5c-ad96-cde6d3a6f3f9-3
00:59:24.235 --> 00:59:30.127
there was no quote increased risk to
interventional cardiologist that got

c65cf45a-a4c7-4e5c-ad96-cde6d3a6f3f9-4
00:59:30.127 --> 00:59:31.800
exposed to radiation.

cb09190d-ecd2-4068-8c99-084653b5e9eb-0
00:59:32.160 --> 00:59:37.098
And we know that is the thought now that
is much bull and that's unfortunate that

cb09190d-ecd2-4068-8c99-084653b5e9eb-1
00:59:37.098 --> 00:59:37.640
came out.

0af4183b-3eda-4337-807f-556b3a269921-0
00:59:38.040 --> 00:59:44.009
I think now with events like this that
bring awareness to the risk to

0af4183b-3eda-4337-807f-556b3a269921-1
00:59:44.009 --> 00:59:50.320
technicians, to cardiologist, the nurses,
all those at work and get labs.

ce5a0286-6b62-4092-bd15-612945adb1fc-0
00:59:50.320 --> 00:59:54.800
If there is a risk that we need better
protection for ourselves.

dd5c8835-b194-4f25-a3a6-1fcb52db242a-0
00:59:54.800 --> 01:00:02.063
But we need to get industry to improve
the devices, the techniques,

dd5c8835-b194-4f25-a3a6-1fcb52db242a-1
01:00:02.063 --> 01:00:04.200
the X-ray equipment.

c0e9d221-702f-4891-8b44-4e41d415ab36-0
01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:08.960
And then this should be a part of the
training for new positions.

021a2899-2bc2-454f-8f8c-ba510c909cd7-0
01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:14.889
And it ought to be required to set
standards on how we protect all those

021a2899-2bc2-454f-8f8c-ba510c909cd7-1
01:00:14.889 --> 01:00:17.080
that are exposed to radiation.

e7e295fa-67e7-4fa7-84e6-74f491f44cea-0
01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:21.696
And I think nowadays with some of the
things that you're doing and some of

e7e295fa-67e7-4fa7-84e6-74f491f44cea-1
01:00:21.696 --> 01:00:23.200
these other companies that.

327ec87d-084c-48a5-91c3-8a58b4ed3bf9-0
01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:28.221
In an industry that's involved,
we will see a better future and less risk

327ec87d-084c-48a5-91c3-8a58b4ed3bf9-1
01:00:28.221 --> 01:00:31.480
to those individuals that are in the
field today.

af588c27-b2c8-4b88-82aa-33d848930080-0
01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:34.560
Well, great.

e90782da-601e-4258-84ca-1330dcd14376-0
01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:39.120
Well, thank you everybody for,
for being in the session.

f095a5d0-4199-4700-b76a-bce30f2cce31-0
01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:43.320
We will be back at 1:15 Eastern Time for
session three.

bfdcb505-c171-43d4-87c1-0debf3499fc6-0
01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:44.600
That's going to be a great session.

61618b75-d55b-4b52-97b0-6bd147902e10-0
01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:47.960
That's protecting your body,
preventing injury and fatigue.

00c4e945-95c0-41e1-a4ca-1ef6ff9166d7-0
01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:51.800
So hope to see you all there and thank
you again for for joining us.

e98c9d22-e711-4383-bf01-dd920452f214-0
01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:53.200
Thank you.

5cd00fa3-bb64-4e30-a309-72238b479d6e-0
01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:54.240
Thank you.
