00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.323
Hi,
my name is Bailey Richardson and today

fbb32631-990b-4205-bacc-040eff7cc6c8-1
00:00:02.323 --> 00:00:06.520
I'm going to be talking about protecting
the team and what techs need to know.

df5cb2f1-87b0-4a4d-8d95-0a741a075aac-0
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.360
These are my disclosures.

6a9b6898-7406-4318-8915-8518822224b4-0
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.459
So our objectives for the talk today are
that after the talk,

6a9b6898-7406-4318-8915-8518822224b4-1
00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:19.778
you're going to be able to explain 3 core
principles of radiation safety,

6a9b6898-7406-4318-8915-8518822224b4-2
00:00:19.778 --> 00:00:22.347
apply 3 techniques to cut fluoroscopy
time,

6a9b6898-7406-4318-8915-8518822224b4-3
00:00:22.347 --> 00:00:27.075
and describe an optimal room set up for
overall radiation safety for the for the

6a9b6898-7406-4318-8915-8518822224b4-4
00:00:27.075 --> 00:00:28.360
Cath lab and IR teams.

da1f7287-0378-4e31-b9cd-615ab51bd499-0
00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.640
So starting out, why does it matter?

b4214b3f-d45b-45b6-830f-90fc2295c804-0
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.840
Radiation exposure leads to a lifelong
risk.

aeea489c-5ec5-4aa9-b067-e06e655a38ce-0
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.280
It's dose dependent and it's cumulative.

b3a14631-ca3e-4491-8238-e15fe1e9c415-0
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.260
Every time that we are exposed to
radiation,

b3a14631-ca3e-4491-8238-e15fe1e9c415-1
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.280
it increases our risk of long term side
effects and complications.

62049691-2ae5-4771-8bab-ea489e2c3197-0
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.747
And being in Cath labs and IR labs where
we're using radiation day in and day out,

62049691-2ae5-4771-8bab-ea489e2c3197-1
00:00:52.747 --> 00:00:56.840
we're at some of the highest risk of any
healthcare professional.

81f36239-50fb-4c09-907a-37be9fe519e5-0
00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.918
And so that's why it's very important and
we're getting a lot more attention to

81f36239-50fb-4c09-907a-37be9fe519e5-1
00:01:01.918 --> 00:01:06.316
this as as the years have gone on and
creating more technologies to help combat

81f36239-50fb-4c09-907a-37be9fe519e5-2
00:01:06.316 --> 00:01:09.560
this so that we can improve our longevity
in the Cath lab.

f5a86747-cd8c-46b6-a8ab-fd51af47714c-0
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.840
Kind of a background story of me,
a Cath lab nurse for over 10 years.

4d40f050-cdca-423d-8297-9c64e18ea360-0
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.386
And I remember when I first started in
the lab didn't really understand the

4d40f050-cdca-423d-8297-9c64e18ea360-1
00:01:19.386 --> 00:01:21.480
importance of, of radiation safety.

7728273a-d4a1-4282-a23c-f6a456b4e270-0
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.718
Like we had a little bit of a laissez
faire kind of culture about it of, yeah,

7728273a-d4a1-4282-a23c-f6a456b4e270-1
00:01:26.718 --> 00:01:31.094
it's there, it's important,
protect yourself, whatever, you know,

7728273a-d4a1-4282-a23c-f6a456b4e270-2
00:01:31.094 --> 00:01:33.880
because we don't see it, we don't feel it.

ca744b81-600a-4ed1-ba29-090459245a58-0
00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.960
So it's very easy to go about your day
and and just kind of ignore it.

e1a53ea8-ebfc-4bc9-9558-64633d4955bd-0
00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:45.160
And so hopefully some of the lessons I've
learned along the way I can spread to you

e1a53ea8-ebfc-4bc9-9558-64633d4955bd-1
00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.200
to help promote more safety and awareness
as far as radiation and what we can do to

e1a53ea8-ebfc-4bc9-9558-64633d4955bd-2
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.240
protect ourselves in the Cath lab.

b17a4ec4-a16d-44b4-8b02-015a4c1a1b1a-0
00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.360
So ultimately why it matters is because
it leads to long term complications.

fedf2ad1-98af-471f-926d-f138b0759531-0
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.640
We're at increased risk for cataracts and
eye problems.

efdd263b-2686-4bf8-94df-266aa3d406d0-0
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.960
We typically see the physicians as having
the biggest risk.

be0fa90d-beb6-451e-81d7-f2ec773e554a-0
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.014
They're closest to the to the radiation
and the source of it,

be0fa90d-beb6-451e-81d7-f2ec773e554a-1
00:02:16.014 --> 00:02:19.480
but that doesn't leave us not exposed to
it as well.

8ec62e62-6146-4ce5-ad15-2f40e1badc82-0
00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.342
So in studies we've seen that
approximately 21% of nurses and techs

8ec62e62-6146-4ce5-ad15-2f40e1badc82-1
00:02:24.342 --> 00:02:29.919
have radiation related lens changes in a
pacifications that lead to cataracts

8ec62e62-6146-4ce5-ad15-2f40e1badc82-2
00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:30.920
later in life.

55944382-a56f-4c8a-bfd2-022b43f39b1a-0
00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.925
And so some of the studies have shown
like we can't really put a dose on it of

55944382-a56f-4c8a-bfd2-022b43f39b1a-1
00:02:36.925 --> 00:02:39.880
what dose exposure really increases that
risk.

24a85fb0-a452-46c1-97f5-841a20a73f06-0
00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.960
It doesn't really have a lower threshold.

686ff186-a511-4b36-9884-c4d51a4e610a-0
00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.999
And so that's why we need to be very
diligent and very important to protecting

686ff186-a511-4b36-9884-c4d51a4e610a-1
00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:50.080
our eyes because the incidence increases
as we age.

b0a48efe-5024-4ed2-ac6b-a2d0f0c6334d-0
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.646
Of course,
that that's just a natural occurrence of

b0a48efe-5024-4ed2-ac6b-a2d0f0c6334d-1
00:02:53.646 --> 00:02:58.025
aging, but when we add radiation to it,
it increases that exponentially as well

b0a48efe-5024-4ed2-ac6b-a2d0f0c6334d-2
00:02:58.025 --> 00:02:59.120
as our years worked.

627b8dd5-74d8-4b72-99ea-f80245dd2411-0
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.960
You know,
Catholic people are a different breed.

ea47f527-f318-4055-a5ae-8014003dc99e-0
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.874
Some people are Cath lab for life and we
want to be able to work as long as we can,

ea47f527-f318-4055-a5ae-8014003dc99e-1
00:03:06.874 --> 00:03:09.800
but not, you know,
sacrifice our bodies to do so.

6973a09e-4458-481b-be48-f67e9846e15d-0
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.273
So one thing that has been shown is that
once we use protective equipment to help

6973a09e-4458-481b-be48-f67e9846e15d-1
00:03:15.273 --> 00:03:18.080
protectorize,
that does decrease the incidence.

8d2c74ec-190d-41b5-8cea-1982a5520f17-0
00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.160
And so that's why it's important to to
use the protective equipment that we have.

dc483dde-444f-4dc8-9c20-0116847ffa3d-0
00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.240
Second is thyroid issues.

a67a0bd0-1c35-4ad1-9ca7-613ec4b7d068-0
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.029
We have an increased incidence of thyroid
nodules about 23%,

a67a0bd0-1c35-4ad1-9ca7-613ec4b7d068-1
00:03:31.029 --> 00:03:37.252
which sometimes you know may not really
lead to anything that we we feel symptoms

a67a0bd0-1c35-4ad1-9ca7-613ec4b7d068-2
00:03:37.252 --> 00:03:37.480
of.

ae53dab3-1998-4079-b83e-0b3a75678f4b-0
00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.317
We could have a subclinical
hypothyroidism,

ae53dab3-1998-4079-b83e-0b3a75678f4b-1
00:03:40.317 --> 00:03:45.153
but long term that increases your risk
for thyroid cancer and the need for

ae53dab3-1998-4079-b83e-0b3a75678f4b-2
00:03:45.153 --> 00:03:50.312
radiation, chemo or even a thyroidectomy,
which can affect you later in life or

ae53dab3-1998-4079-b83e-0b3a75678f4b-3
00:03:50.312 --> 00:03:52.440
even even as a as a young person.

33b889a9-8fd1-4de6-8bda-f78b34e94d62-0
00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.245
We're increasing our our risk for that
and it could ultimately take us out of

33b889a9-8fd1-4de6-8bda-f78b34e94d62-1
00:03:57.245 --> 00:03:58.000
the Cath lab.

e49e0c56-bb1f-446a-8142-7b3d3115e440-0
00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.256
And another issue that it seems like a
little bit more insidious or that we

e49e0c56-bb1f-446a-8142-7b3d3115e440-1
00:04:04.256 --> 00:04:07.267
don't really, you know,
reflect on radiation,

e49e0c56-bb1f-446a-8142-7b3d3115e440-2
00:04:07.267 --> 00:04:11.720
but it's the orthopedic strain because we
are wearing lead all day.

4d649278-f1c4-4da6-9672-582e826c89d0-0
00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.778
We're wearing heavy stuff that is not
very good for our body mechanics and

4d649278-f1c4-4da6-9672-582e826c89d0-1
00:04:16.778 --> 00:04:20.285
ergonomics,
but we have to wear our lead to protect

4d649278-f1c4-4da6-9672-582e826c89d0-2
00:04:20.285 --> 00:04:20.960
ourselves.

988a4e9a-f86b-4e7d-a92a-dbb467379402-0
00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.880
But that can lead to our orthopedic
strain.

ec273155-2704-4400-97f7-6f153fb471e8-0
00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.440
And 60 to 62% of techs and nurses report
neck and back pain.

afe9cb76-32f4-4beb-95ce-1b48963ec38b-0
00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.683
I mean,
I'm in my in my 30s and I already have

afe9cb76-32f4-4beb-95ce-1b48963ec38b-1
00:04:30.683 --> 00:04:34.119
neck pain from, you know, one,
not having good posture,

afe9cb76-32f4-4beb-95ce-1b48963ec38b-2
00:04:34.119 --> 00:04:35.960
but wearing lead all the time.

c1aae72c-ed55-4db4-9d32-da5bcbbe1073-0
00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.490
We are as Cath lab nurses and techs,
unlike the physicians,

c1aae72c-ed55-4db4-9d32-da5bcbbe1073-1
00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.120
we're in the Cath lab every day,
all day for hours on end.

6e2e258e-29d5-422d-b730-c1fbfc0ba0a2-0
00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.156
We don't really have big breaks in
between, you know,

6e2e258e-29d5-422d-b730-c1fbfc0ba0a2-1
00:04:47.156 --> 00:04:49.040
and then we take call on the weekends.

12417527-9697-4d69-9cea-1e0558645aa9-0
00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.884
So our risk for orthopedic strain is much
higher because we're wearing these,

12417527-9697-4d69-9cea-1e0558645aa9-1
00:04:54.884 --> 00:04:58.554
these protective equipment for longer
periods of time,

12417527-9697-4d69-9cea-1e0558645aa9-2
00:04:58.554 --> 00:05:03.958
but also because it does cause a strain,
it can lead us to not want to use these

12417527-9697-4d69-9cea-1e0558645aa9-3
00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.359
protective equipment.

29456dc0-7f0d-4a47-8fe8-f50a69be0c69-0
00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.815
It's easy to just say,
I'm going to run into this case real

29456dc0-7f0d-4a47-8fe8-f50a69be0c69-1
00:05:07.815 --> 00:05:10.640
quick, help someone out and then I'll,
I'll jet back out real quick.

feb3d805-4283-4fd2-b8fd-cf787b8cefb3-0
00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.697
It's easy to to say, oh,
I don't need to put it on like my back

feb3d805-4283-4fd2-b8fd-cf787b8cefb3-1
00:05:14.697 --> 00:05:15.760
hurts or whatever.

8c259bea-7e52-4596-ab1e-b62b16fda032-0
00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.708
So, so just keeping that in mind,
that kind of exposes,

8c259bea-7e52-4596-ab1e-b62b16fda032-1
00:05:19.708 --> 00:05:21.400
exposes us even further.

91212fb0-741f-498b-8e3e-faba48448ab6-0
00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.451
So as we learn about why we need to
protect ourselves because of our

91212fb0-741f-498b-8e3e-faba48448ab6-1
00:05:26.451 --> 00:05:29.137
increased risk of,
of strain on our bodies,

91212fb0-741f-498b-8e3e-faba48448ab6-2
00:05:29.137 --> 00:05:34.081
but also things that can affect us long
term and create negative health effects,

91212fb0-741f-498b-8e3e-faba48448ab6-3
00:05:34.081 --> 00:05:38.720
we always need to learn the three core
principles for protecting ourselves.

ca2227d1-a132-487b-9ba8-3b1449fa520f-0
00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.983
And while we've learned throughout this
whole symposium of,

ca2227d1-a132-487b-9ba8-3b1449fa520f-1
00:05:41.983 --> 00:05:45.956
of different sort of technology that is
emerging to help with orthopedic strain,

ca2227d1-a132-487b-9ba8-3b1449fa520f-2
00:05:45.956 --> 00:05:49.635
to help with greater protection,
we can't ignore the three core principles

ca2227d1-a132-487b-9ba8-3b1449fa520f-3
00:05:49.635 --> 00:05:50.959
of protectioning ourselves.

93bd4b30-1b6a-408d-9b20-303337b009b7-0
00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:56.999
These should never go away and it should
always be our underlying baseline that we

93bd4b30-1b6a-408d-9b20-303337b009b7-1
00:05:56.999 --> 00:06:00.400
go to and that is time,
distance and shielding.

15eeb69f-eb48-46f5-8559-facbb5198c88-0
00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.120
So our first score principle is time.

e50abf9f-a314-4f23-a521-e8c9abe2a8e1-0
00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.880
We want to use the lowest pulse and frame
rates as possible.

db142933-0db8-4aa8-ac96-d5031d5dcb17-0
00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:16.550
We want to stay off of fluoro and cine as
much as possible, use Fluorosafe,

db142933-0db8-4aa8-ac96-d5031d5dcb17-1
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:17.360
use our Rd.

467090c5-28e9-4b31-9826-4a062255aa54-0
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.222
maps,
set ourselves up for success of of

467090c5-28e9-4b31-9826-4a062255aa54-1
00:06:20.222 --> 00:06:24.760
minimizing that time that we're actually
on cine or even fluoro.

d29b36bb-5bde-480b-99af-b3afdbfebf3d-0
00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.320
Second is distance.

10d1cc5c-4219-42a4-9f08-99e3a3d7b3e3-0
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:27.880
Very simple.

ed4de32e-289f-4470-a540-85f3b3720e5b-0
00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:33.600
The further away you are from the source
of radiation, your dose decreases.

78c5c9e2-52d0-4d7c-ba42-2101acdbbef7-0
00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:37.317
So you know,
sometimes some of our staff are a little

78c5c9e2-52d0-4d7c-ba42-2101acdbbef7-1
00:06:37.317 --> 00:06:42.113
bit more mobile, like the nurses can,
can be further away, but not always the,

78c5c9e2-52d0-4d7c-ba42-2101acdbbef7-2
00:06:42.113 --> 00:06:46.120
the physician and the,
and the scrub tech that's up at the table.

af1d2d7d-2675-4ae6-8f04-68c693fd38d7-0
00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.591
But if you have the opportunity to be
further away,

af1d2d7d-2675-4ae6-8f04-68c693fd38d7-1
00:06:49.591 --> 00:06:53.664
be as far away from from the source as
possible at all time,

af1d2d7d-2675-4ae6-8f04-68c693fd38d7-2
00:06:53.664 --> 00:06:55.200
whenever it's feasible.

7a98ffe5-e743-4310-a50a-5a262c06741e-0
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.900
And then finally,
shielding using all your personal

7a98ffe5-e743-4310-a50a-5a262c06741e-1
00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:01.411
protective equipment,
say dress for success,

7a98ffe5-e743-4310-a50a-5a262c06741e-2
00:07:01.411 --> 00:07:04.088
wear your lead Avron,
wear your thyroid collar,

7a98ffe5-e743-4310-a50a-5a262c06741e-3
00:07:04.088 --> 00:07:06.320
have lead glasses that protect yourself.

1780cbbc-262f-481a-a799-09c3cf61f359-0
00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.754
And that's something that all of our
administrators,

1780cbbc-262f-481a-a799-09c3cf61f359-1
00:07:09.754 --> 00:07:14.336
our leadership or Cath labs should be
providing for us and should be providing

1780cbbc-262f-481a-a799-09c3cf61f359-2
00:07:14.336 --> 00:07:18.280
for us equipment that fits us so that
we're more likely to wear it.

461dbb95-85ad-43e2-bb8a-51eb85fdc657-0
00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:22.615
And that's going to decrease our
orthopedic strain and increase our

461dbb95-85ad-43e2-bb8a-51eb85fdc657-1
00:07:22.615 --> 00:07:26.440
likelihood to be wearing our protective
equipment properly.

76574ec6-45d9-4b43-a1e3-f674591635ed-0
00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:31.014
We also want to use the Shields that are
in the room, the suspended Shields,

76574ec6-45d9-4b43-a1e3-f674591635ed-1
00:07:31.014 --> 00:07:35.026
the table skirts, the mobile barriers,
moving those around so that we're closing

76574ec6-45d9-4b43-a1e3-f674591635ed-2
00:07:35.026 --> 00:07:36.760
all the different gaps that we can.

b52542cd-6367-47f6-a542-3b80e2207d6f-0
00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:39.961
Whereas if you're at the foot of the
table,

b52542cd-6367-47f6-a542-3b80e2207d6f-1
00:07:39.961 --> 00:07:45.069
getting some extra skirts or barriers to
help protect yourselves whenever you

b52542cd-6367-47f6-a542-3b80e2207d6f-2
00:07:45.069 --> 00:07:50.046
can't afford to be far away from the
table or put distance between yourself

b52542cd-6367-47f6-a542-3b80e2207d6f-3
00:07:50.046 --> 00:07:51.880
and the source of radiation.

d9860bbe-d52c-4300-bad0-eaa9124dc917-0
00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:58.330
So as we go through all this,
we can use this simple safety checklist

d9860bbe-d52c-4300-bad0-eaa9124dc917-1
00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:01.760
that we use before,
during and after our procedures.

ac4aacb8-22fc-4a8d-999a-e8dea0d1943b-0
00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.996
So before you want to check your lead
aprons, check your thyroid Shields,

ac4aacb8-22fc-4a8d-999a-e8dea0d1943b-1
00:08:05.996 --> 00:08:07.240
make sure you have your glasses.

52e2828f-2591-4aa6-9cc1-398520e9c0ce-0
00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:09.880
Everyone in the case has everything that
they need.

7bc15e4a-5e18-49a3-a119-88f832540d5b-0
00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:14.226
Make sure that your Shields that are
mobile are are working,

7bc15e4a-5e18-49a3-a119-88f832540d5b-1
00:08:14.226 --> 00:08:15.560
they're not damaged.

6306a25e-51cd-48fc-8ffb-9c73f451c47b-0
00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:20.040
Make sure that you have a mobile shield
in the room for your nurse.

d7374b45-7fbd-4fc0-a41d-369059781e02-0
00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:23.462
Sometimes this, you know,
we have tons of stuff in some of these

d7374b45-7fbd-4fc0-a41d-369059781e02-1
00:08:23.462 --> 00:08:24.080
small rooms.

6ff75614-5824-47e9-8a3f-6c1b1b4272f6-0
00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:29.597
And so we just want to make sure that we
have room for those and make that a

6ff75614-5824-47e9-8a3f-6c1b1b4272f6-1
00:08:29.597 --> 00:08:30.200
priority.

035a7e00-520d-4fda-8e2e-bc3112f3bde7-0
00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:36.160
Also confirm your flora settings,
your your low frame rate.

e618f161-00ca-4fad-aed6-242f5af158ae-0
00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:39.760
Make sure that your columnators are
working before you start the case.

96e6c2ff-f4b3-458b-8eec-ba1888e5f9d5-0
00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:47.090
2nd, it's during the case,
anticipate your operators needs so that

96e6c2ff-f4b3-458b-8eec-ba1888e5f9d5-1
00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:51.842
you can reduce your floor time of really
planning out that case saying, hey doc,

96e6c2ff-f4b3-458b-8eec-ba1888e5f9d5-2
00:08:51.842 --> 00:08:52.840
what's your plan?

554055fb-c2eb-45cc-abc0-cc6f4b0be8c5-0
00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:54.680
Like what views do you want?

16aa4aa7-76eb-4a9a-be24-425b8043d07d-0
00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:58.425
So that we can make sure that we're,
we're angulated properly,

16aa4aa7-76eb-4a9a-be24-425b8043d07d-1
00:08:58.425 --> 00:09:01.395
We're in place when the physician is
ready to send a,

16aa4aa7-76eb-4a9a-be24-425b8043d07d-2
00:09:01.395 --> 00:09:04.750
but also like just kind of
troubleshooting to say, hey, doc,

16aa4aa7-76eb-4a9a-be24-425b8043d07d-3
00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:05.960
this is a big patient.

02b35aeb-b1e4-45c3-9704-3aa2eea7c76f-0
00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.360
We're going to be using a lot more
radiation.

150d36b4-92d2-46df-a299-e17c8c614163-0
00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:10.920
So can I, what can I do to decrease that?

a1b234e7-717f-4cc0-bf2b-7504be378b9a-0
00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:15.857
Can I decrease my angulations or can we
decrease the amount of runs that we that

a1b234e7-717f-4cc0-bf2b-7504be378b9a-1
00:09:15.857 --> 00:09:20.916
we have And really just working together
as a team to anticipate what you're going

a1b234e7-717f-4cc0-bf2b-7504be378b9a-2
00:09:20.916 --> 00:09:23.720
to need so that we can reduce that
radiation.

d3ab8b39-1a0e-41bd-bc06-21898c06b5c2-0
00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.120
Stand on the side of the intensifier.

af76bada-a31c-459b-930f-aeb796c1367e-0
00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:29.120
Don't stand as close to stand close to
the tube.

e98d0845-2c05-44b1-b0b4-3774415da6b6-0
00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:30.000
If possible.

7598750e-c3eb-47dd-a508-6befefd96119-0
00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.760
Step back when you're not actively
engaged.

467c1494-6af9-446a-87ec-a502deef61ea-0
00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:33.640
Especially for nurses.

ad3426bc-a373-4912-a057-17d02be1e62e-0
00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:37.469
Sometimes as a new nurse,
I always like to be next to the table and

ad3426bc-a373-4912-a057-17d02be1e62e-1
00:09:37.469 --> 00:09:41.805
see what's going on and was really not
knowingly exposing myself to a lot of

ad3426bc-a373-4912-a057-17d02be1e62e-2
00:09:41.805 --> 00:09:42.200
ration.

22048d05-3d42-429c-89aa-a9750c9e1d9a-0
00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:43.960
So step back if you can.

6756fa68-9e26-449a-988f-bc89fc626bd2-0
00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:46.600
If,
if you don't need to be right up there

6756fa68-9e26-449a-988f-bc89fc626bd2-1
00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:50.040
next to where the radiation is,
step back and speak up.

2cab21f7-ea65-4a1a-8f18-1dfb4be222df-0
00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:54.163
If something is missing, like a shield,
or if the doctor's working and someone

2cab21f7-ea65-4a1a-8f18-1dfb4be222df-1
00:09:54.163 --> 00:09:57.400
walks into the room, say, hey, doc,
so and so is in the room.

7930b688-f89e-4383-831b-524aea6de4da-0
00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.120
Can we, can we come off fluoro real quick?

9240447f-19ad-4198-9b80-3d640e389517-0
00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:02.160
You know, or, or tell the person that,
hey, we're on fluoro.

b44834e7-e2bc-4a8f-aafc-083e51ea3a67-0
00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:07.080
You do step out or wait while we're not
doing that or go, go put on some lead.

bee02f4b-a60f-4c71-be34-6db79b2947d8-0
00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.440
You need to speak up.

8370a23d-9832-4965-9dd2-4c7a93e779b2-0
00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:11.782
Because sometimes we get so engaged in
what we're doing that we,

8370a23d-9832-4965-9dd2-4c7a93e779b2-1
00:10:11.782 --> 00:10:16.000
we don't pay attention to everyone else
in the room and making sure they're safe.

7a2fdb88-6348-4f58-b980-93905440a0df-0
00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:20.883
And so after the case,
we're going to make sure we're recording,

7a2fdb88-6348-4f58-b980-93905440a0df-1
00:10:20.883 --> 00:10:24.298
reviewing our dissimilar readings,
making sure everyone's wearing their

7a2fdb88-6348-4f58-b980-93905440a0df-2
00:10:24.298 --> 00:10:27.240
dissimitors, you know,
they fall off sometimes they get lost.

47f96449-7f7d-44f9-8505-480019dd897a-0
00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:31.499
Make sure that everyone's wearing one in
the room and that we're recording those

47f96449-7f7d-44f9-8505-480019dd897a-1
00:10:31.499 --> 00:10:34.840
and recording the amount of radiation
that's used during each case.

2bccb47f-efbd-4220-aaa8-c9648ba5518a-0
00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:38.200
Really looking at that rather than just
writing down a number and going on.

374f04dc-877e-4348-a320-5f81ff1398b8-0
00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:42.998
Because sometimes we get high doses and
we need to stop and say, hey, let's,

374f04dc-877e-4348-a320-5f81ff1398b8-1
00:10:42.998 --> 00:10:46.239
let's debrief,
let's talk about why we use so much,

374f04dc-877e-4348-a320-5f81ff1398b8-2
00:10:46.239 --> 00:10:49.480
what we could have done differently to to
use less.

2f431db4-9b03-4575-8ddb-a205b0bad91c-0
00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:52.912
Or if we have a patient similar patient
in, you know,

2f431db4-9b03-4575-8ddb-a205b0bad91c-1
00:10:52.912 --> 00:10:56.600
in the future that's maybe big or you
have complications.

83a1a800-bf59-43e1-a484-f08eec80d6cf-0
00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:59.520
What do we need to do to decrease our
radiation?

6b295dd0-cdc2-4432-8bce-b5dae14fcaad-0
00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:03.640
Also sharing lessons with your team,
with your fellows.

619cf556-25da-4d4d-964f-388fa46bd7fd-0
00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.235
You know,
some Cath lab staff have been around the

619cf556-25da-4d4d-964f-388fa46bd7fd-1
00:11:06.235 --> 00:11:06.480
block.

f6d971eb-75ef-4f24-ba04-8eee55ec417b-0
00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:09.168
We've been here for a while and sometimes
have,

f6d971eb-75ef-4f24-ba04-8eee55ec417b-1
00:11:09.168 --> 00:11:12.920
have done some stupid stuff that's really
exposed us to radiation.

6a64d389-6e15-420c-80df-1e2e19557abd-0
00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:15.751
But it's really important to share those
stories like, hey,

6a64d389-6e15-420c-80df-1e2e19557abd-1
00:11:15.751 --> 00:11:19.480
when I was in this situation where a
patient may have been coding, I did this.

c42ff7d5-1e3a-45e9-801a-9ae9a12278fc-0
00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.600
But this is what we need to do
differently.

c060f625-4f35-4f02-b9bf-7c00a0115c5e-0
00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:24.827
Don't don't do as I do sometimes,
you know,

c060f625-4f35-4f02-b9bf-7c00a0115c5e-1
00:11:24.827 --> 00:11:30.620
protect yourself for the long term and
always look for continuous improvement of

c060f625-4f35-4f02-b9bf-7c00a0115c5e-2
00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:32.480
upon your your strategies.

a7c4cfff-6eef-41e8-93b6-ec196e00290f-0
00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:36.760
Optimal room setup is very important.

9b330bc1-3fc6-4f39-82c2-eff6fe97550a-0
00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:40.835
This should hopefully be done beforehand
so that you have everything before you

9b330bc1-3fc6-4f39-82c2-eff6fe97550a-1
00:11:40.835 --> 00:11:41.600
start the case.

bd720635-a72e-43c5-b3da-75653f764a5b-0
00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:44.814
Making sure your mobile Shields are in
the room,

bd720635-a72e-43c5-b3da-75653f764a5b-1
00:11:44.814 --> 00:11:49.658
making sure that your your table Shields
are in place and also making sure you're

bd720635-a72e-43c5-b3da-75653f764a5b-2
00:11:49.658 --> 00:11:50.840
dressed for success.

13ed5aab-2694-45c1-9a8e-da21b161dbf9-0
00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:55.151
As we said of having your glasses,
your thyroid collar,

13ed5aab-2694-45c1-9a8e-da21b161dbf9-1
00:11:55.151 --> 00:12:01.234
having your lead that fits you and being
conscious of how close you are to the

13ed5aab-2694-45c1-9a8e-da21b161dbf9-2
00:12:01.234 --> 00:12:04.160
table really has a a greater exposure.

c88deff8-f7eb-4609-b33d-7d6bbc3f3821-0
00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:08.225
So the further way you can get,
the better it is and really keeping in

c88deff8-f7eb-4609-b33d-7d6bbc3f3821-1
00:12:08.225 --> 00:12:12.120
mind of the people in the room and their
level of exposure as well.

ebbc32f3-768d-405b-a204-20821f56f29b-0
00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.915
So finally,
we're all about creating a culture of

ebbc32f3-768d-405b-a204-20821f56f29b-1
00:12:18.915 --> 00:12:19.240
safety.

cc84beb9-bf96-49e2-9e5e-3da7cbb4a6df-0
00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:20.800
We know these things.

e010ab20-03bf-4b49-967b-1c3ae71415bf-0
00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:22.800
We know why we need to protect ourselves.

5dada98a-333a-4cd8-b6a3-ab5fd8d2e5e9-0
00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:26.501
We're at an increased risk for for
radiation exposure,

5dada98a-333a-4cd8-b6a3-ab5fd8d2e5e9-1
00:12:26.501 --> 00:12:30.880
for long term complications, cataracts,
cancers, orthopedic strain.

e19dbecf-d1d3-4d8f-a3bf-5d6019c720a6-0
00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:35.907
We have to protect ourselves to protect
our long term career in the Cath lab,

e19dbecf-d1d3-4d8f-a3bf-5d6019c720a6-1
00:12:35.907 --> 00:12:38.720
but also for whenever we retire later in
life.

a95eecdd-5438-4efb-98d2-60564c83d225-0
00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:43.287
We don't want to have damaged our bodies
so bad that we can't enjoy life with our

a95eecdd-5438-4efb-98d2-60564c83d225-1
00:12:43.287 --> 00:12:44.680
family, with our friends.

d46f58af-07d7-47ec-b05d-eb09d6de9107-0
00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:49.240
And so make safety a part of your routine,
not an option.

a8af1c91-e5e2-4a28-82fd-5114a10b8efb-0
00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:51.760
It's it's an absolute of everyday.

c2b9c085-b7ac-4f9d-97fa-ba595a490436-0
00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:58.510
Encourage speaking up with respectful
safety reminders of just saying, Hey, doc,

c2b9c085-b7ac-4f9d-97fa-ba595a490436-1
00:12:58.510 --> 00:12:59.920
like you're on Sene.

9d2ed79b-a09e-429d-9224-82e850a8d8ad-0
00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:03.929
Can you get off or you're just sitting on
Floro Because sometimes people's minds

9d2ed79b-a09e-429d-9224-82e850a8d8ad-1
00:13:03.929 --> 00:13:06.850
wander and and we just need to be
respectful of like, hey,

9d2ed79b-a09e-429d-9224-82e850a8d8ad-2
00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:08.880
like can you come off Floro for a second?

c2232ca7-01d8-4ba9-b29f-e069f0233ed9-0
00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:11.678
Or if someone walks the room and say, Hey,
can you,

c2232ca7-01d8-4ba9-b29f-e069f0233ed9-1
00:13:11.678 --> 00:13:15.875
can you put some lead on things like that,
just keeping each one accountable,

c2232ca7-01d8-4ba9-b29f-e069f0233ed9-2
00:13:15.875 --> 00:13:18.942
but doing it in a respectful way,
supporting each other,

c2232ca7-01d8-4ba9-b29f-e069f0233ed9-3
00:13:18.942 --> 00:13:22.440
protecting the team of telling someone,
hey, you need to let up.

35752a37-59ca-4551-915a-59854d3b51a1-0
00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:25.551
Or I love the routine of before cases
start,

35752a37-59ca-4551-915a-59854d3b51a1-1
00:13:25.551 --> 00:13:30.320
when the physician takes the lead and
says, hey, I'm about to start the case.

61867868-2f04-4be8-ac89-1cc62a6b4a05-0
00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:31.480
Does everyone have lead?

6bef6112-5fed-4319-beb7-8e4637ad4b21-0
00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:34.792
If you don't go get it or,
or get out or you know,

6bef6112-5fed-4319-beb7-8e4637ad4b21-1
00:13:34.792 --> 00:13:37.564
just really kind of setting that standard
of,

6bef6112-5fed-4319-beb7-8e4637ad4b21-2
00:13:37.564 --> 00:13:41.119
of you need to be letted up by care for
your safety or if,

6bef6112-5fed-4319-beb7-8e4637ad4b21-3
00:13:41.119 --> 00:13:46.000
if you're going to approach the table,
let me know and I will come off the city.

99c02b5c-488c-4c14-929e-8672973c3691-0
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.021
So you can do whatever it is that you
need to do with the patient and then get

99c02b5c-488c-4c14-929e-8672973c3691-1
00:13:50.021 --> 00:13:51.040
back out of the way.

9a227c25-ab8b-45c9-bb84-0ba72603e30e-0
00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:55.640
And our leadership and our techs have a
shared responsibility.

911c0eee-65ef-4771-99fd-21dd67f4cf16-0
00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:59.543
It's the shared responsibility of our
administration or of our physicians as

911c0eee-65ef-4771-99fd-21dd67f4cf16-1
00:13:59.543 --> 00:14:00.760
well as us individually.

158eddc0-7f61-4314-836e-9f141d8c5237-0
00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:04.802
And it's,
it's so important for for administrators

158eddc0-7f61-4314-836e-9f141d8c5237-1
00:14:04.802 --> 00:14:08.385
to know this,
for a cathode management to know this of

158eddc0-7f61-4314-836e-9f141d8c5237-2
00:14:08.385 --> 00:14:12.359
providing the proper equipment,
providing lead that fits us.

1a405a59-2e25-4f7c-8746-0d158d22a57e-0
00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:15.504
You know,
there should never be anyone who doesn't

1a405a59-2e25-4f7c-8746-0d158d22a57e-1
00:14:15.504 --> 00:14:17.520
have lead that fits them properly.

be080df6-ef5d-4449-9e32-1f7771504680-0
00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:21.177
You know, we may not get the right color,
it may not look fun,

be080df6-ef5d-4449-9e32-1f7771504680-1
00:14:21.177 --> 00:14:22.800
but it has to fit you properly.

df692ad5-2672-49f7-8ec2-e5d89e4919dd-0
00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:27.925
There should be no if ands or buts about
that of providing it properly fitting

df692ad5-2672-49f7-8ec2-e5d89e4919dd-1
00:14:27.925 --> 00:14:28.240
lead.

90af5fea-74e7-4f8a-9e9c-e036216762ec-0
00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:32.412
Everyone should have have that recallers
and access to lead glasses if that is

90af5fea-74e7-4f8a-9e9c-e036216762ec-1
00:14:32.412 --> 00:14:33.680
what they desired to wear.

016bbfa2-a878-4dd4-ac7c-a178fc8d0ceb-0
00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.971
We should also have access to lead
Shields and these are the responsibility

016bbfa2-a878-4dd4-ac7c-a178fc8d0ceb-1
00:14:39.971 --> 00:14:42.000
of everybody from the top down.

80f4c1ee-50c4-4f0c-b0e6-6c67ab72f64b-0
00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:47.393
So these are things that we need to speak
up for ourselves of making sure that

80f4c1ee-50c4-4f0c-b0e6-6c67ab72f64b-1
00:14:47.393 --> 00:14:49.480
those are provided for everybody.

d09fe0ff-e729-425a-b6ac-529e90422690-0
00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:52.760
And so finally, just rumor.

ff894531-3cfa-4ba8-b346-15ca1933c854-0
00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:53.480
A key takeaways.

a816c54b-54fb-4a5d-862b-4909fa642bab-0
00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:54.760
It's very, very simple.

a8918b6f-86c9-4ee5-aa1a-b6fe5f8b51a8-0
00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:57.870
You know,
we have all this different new technology,

a8918b6f-86c9-4ee5-aa1a-b6fe5f8b51a8-1
00:14:57.870 --> 00:15:02.373
but it comes down to the basics that we
have to implement every day to reduce our

a8918b6f-86c9-4ee5-aa1a-b6fe5f8b51a8-2
00:15:02.373 --> 00:15:05.064
exposure to radiation,
which is minimizing time,

a8918b6f-86c9-4ee5-aa1a-b6fe5f8b51a8-3
00:15:05.064 --> 00:15:07.920
maximizing your distance,
and using your shielding.

c01a8485-5cbd-4ade-aabd-2b1755eefe1f-0
00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:12.507
If you don't use any of these,
you don't use the equipment that is given

c01a8485-5cbd-4ade-aabd-2b1755eefe1f-1
00:15:12.507 --> 00:15:15.040
to you,
then it kind of defeats the purpose.

31c72ab5-2b33-4cb8-94d0-20a041b07dcf-0
00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:19.838
It has to be implemented every single day
and ultimately it's protects yourself,

31c72ab5-2b33-4cb8-94d0-20a041b07dcf-1
00:15:19.838 --> 00:15:24.636
it's protecting your team and protecting
your long term career of your longevity

31c72ab5-2b33-4cb8-94d0-20a041b07dcf-2
00:15:24.636 --> 00:15:29.375
in new Cath lab and even afterwards to
protect yourself for your family and for

31c72ab5-2b33-4cb8-94d0-20a041b07dcf-3
00:15:29.375 --> 00:15:34.114
your, for your work like home life and,
and everything that you want to do even

31c72ab5-2b33-4cb8-94d0-20a041b07dcf-4
00:15:34.114 --> 00:15:35.240
outside of the lab.

b42f26f6-ebc2-4e1b-ae59-9a4c485b3155-0
00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:39.560
So thank you so much for the opportunity
for this presentation.

7d4b7378-4cbc-44e5-82ea-cdb7f9c9126d-0
00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:44.000
This is my contact information and thank
you so much.

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:48.080
Good afternoon.

f03e2209-65a4-4062-a015-9404b3d80593-0
00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:53.730
It's an honor to join you at the SER 2025
to share the interventionist in

f03e2209-65a4-4062-a015-9404b3d80593-1
00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:56.480
perspective on radiation protection.

480c736e-065d-4a19-925e-83523b3e3206-0
00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:58.440
In today environment.

8084d10f-8876-42d2-8b2c-a99a5b07e39e-0
00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:03.080
Safeguarding our staff and patient is
just as vital as technical excellence.

96a0da5f-a15f-46cb-914b-dfab5e12d302-0
00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:08.340
I will highlight practical strategies,
shared responsibilities and evidence

96a0da5f-a15f-46cb-914b-dfab5e12d302-1
00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:12.760
based methods to ensure safety while
advancing the quality of care.

b72aa782-754f-49db-a557-39c3c17c75aa-0
00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:19.640
I have no disclosures.

6c1259f2-9ba8-4b3d-82d8-579eb9596346-0
00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:25.640
Diagnostic imaging procedures,
with the exception of Mr.

e13e5630-197a-4c45-803a-6787c91a41b8-0
00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:29.889
imaging and ultrasound,
contribute more than 9090% of the

e13e5630-197a-4c45-803a-6787c91a41b8-1
00:16:29.889 --> 00:16:33.920
exposure to artificial radiation in the
United States.

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:39.340
Therefore, it is vital that patients,
visitors and hospital staff and reality

5c33ff18-9173-46bf-9c40-c9f98b5e3d51-1
00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:44.425
personnel receive as small radiation
exposure as possible from medical imaging

5c33ff18-9173-46bf-9c40-c9f98b5e3d51-2
00:16:44.425 --> 00:16:45.520
and examinations.

a96bcf60-6e76-4aa0-8952-7c2a7a4deba7-0
00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:56.240
It is crucial to review the fundamentals
of radiation protections.

2eb04eec-26f7-420c-9ef6-e2def3a3780c-0
00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:01.440
As we can see, time,
distance and shieldings are the cardinal

2eb04eec-26f7-420c-9ef6-e2def3a3780c-1
00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:03.840
rules for radiation protection.

30d7c7c4-3915-428e-b138-2457e2652fe9-0
00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:14.250
Scattered radiation, it's the real enemy.

19e595ea-c8ef-4acc-9f46-ec5674e4fcc6-0
00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:15.650
That's how we can see.

a82f4ccf-c874-4710-8c0f-f8eed3ec8214-0
00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:22.558
It is the radiation that goes through the
patient and then it goes multi planes and

a82f4ccf-c874-4710-8c0f-f8eed3ec8214-1
00:17:22.558 --> 00:17:26.177
every,
every patient kind of made this this

a82f4ccf-c874-4710-8c0f-f8eed3ec8214-2
00:17:26.177 --> 00:17:27.000
radiation.

84f62fa4-0fae-4738-8636-072ee64cfef6-0
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.976
So we have to be careful when we are
around it is that's that's the the

84f62fa4-0fae-4738-8636-072ee64cfef6-1
00:17:31.976 --> 00:17:37.160
radiation that is pretty bad for the
staff and also the medical personnel.

32cffe7c-38e5-4235-abd9-602f42ee65ba-0
00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:44.080
When we talk about distance in inverse
square law is the key.

c6c472fd-d0e3-4d32-8ed5-c9060ec042a9-0
00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:49.880
As we double the distance the dose is
going to minimize by a factor of 4.

59702762-340c-46bb-b3d8-2e680fa55c9e-0
00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:54.640
Those are your product.

463f414b-b7b9-47a6-891a-ab0677334ab9-0
00:17:54.640 --> 00:18:00.115
This is what we use basically to express
the amount of radiation the patient

463f414b-b7b9-47a6-891a-ab0677334ab9-1
00:18:00.115 --> 00:18:05.377
received through the procedure is,
is expressing sievers and it's kind of

463f414b-b7b9-47a6-891a-ab0677334ab9-2
00:18:05.377 --> 00:18:08.648
like,
you know tracks all the accumulation of

463f414b-b7b9-47a6-891a-ab0677334ab9-3
00:18:08.648 --> 00:18:09.360
radiation.

25dd0e4b-26d0-40f3-b168-d6ec16cf432b-0
00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:12.765
Those we have to be aware of Sentinel
events,

25dd0e4b-26d0-40f3-b168-d6ec16cf432b-1
00:18:12.765 --> 00:18:17.799
just making sure that we know the numbers
when it's higher than 50,

25dd0e4b-26d0-40f3-b168-d6ec16cf432b-2
00:18:17.799 --> 00:18:21.648
000 milligrays or 1500 Grays by
centimeters square,

25dd0e4b-26d0-40f3-b168-d6ec16cf432b-3
00:18:21.648 --> 00:18:24.240
that's like that's a central event.

17c31d58-4360-4859-a65c-390691ed9c03-0
00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:27.400
So it have to be we need to be away from
from those numbers.

1379572f-9a9c-4565-8c81-f51f951c51e5-0
00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:39.510
Absurd doors is is also an all important
concept that we should be reviewing.

24200f27-eedc-4301-8760-933c2f19d7d2-0
00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:45.710
It is expressing grace that is equal to
one grade and kind of like 100 rats.

e6106a59-5005-49f0-b493-951a4f0a2d34-0
00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:50.736
So this is give you kind of like an
explanation about radiation dose are

e6106a59-5005-49f0-b493-951a4f0a2d34-1
00:18:50.736 --> 00:18:55.520
absorbed by tissues following the
exposure to ionizing ionizing radiation.

9db2ddcb-bd6d-49a1-800c-8d8cd73d93bc-0
00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:04.649
Also those equivalent, you know,
it's kind of like comes in an importance

9db2ddcb-bd6d-49a1-800c-8d8cd73d93bc-1
00:19:04.649 --> 00:19:07.320
when we talk about radiation safety.

f431d048-6fc8-4ee3-af82-d6eb3c217a5c-0
00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:14.033
It's it's kind of like the product of the
assort dose and a quality factor which

f431d048-6fc8-4ee3-af82-d6eb3c217a5c-1
00:19:14.033 --> 00:19:19.546
takes into account the effects of
different types of radiation is 1 siever

f431d048-6fc8-4ee3-af82-d6eb3c217a5c-2
00:19:19.546 --> 00:19:22.560
you kind of see that is equal to 100 RAM.

ea3bd8b1-9fff-44ea-8e29-dd6a23105d8c-0
00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:31.680
It's kind of like give us a better
comparison effective dose.

d4104738-6fff-4fd8-9283-bf7b0cf94323-0
00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:36.751
It's expressed in Milliseiever and it's
it's kind of like explaining the

d4104738-6fff-4fd8-9283-bf7b0cf94323-1
00:19:36.751 --> 00:19:41.720
radiation sensitivity when it comes into
different cell types and tissue size.

3fa6cc23-ec5f-409c-b906-8926261bc363-0
00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:48.600
It give us an explanation about the risk
of radiation effects.

e51f31ed-b60a-4886-a9e4-2f7716a3242d-0
00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:56.990
Having those concepts in mind,
we can now see the comparisons between

e51f31ed-b60a-4886-a9e4-2f7716a3242d-1
00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:58.520
the affected dose.

2d0c3c70-d797-4aaf-a406-597580e84133-0
00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:02.236
So we can have kind of like a easy
explanation,

2d0c3c70-d797-4aaf-a406-597580e84133-1
00:20:02.236 --> 00:20:07.280
like when we perform an X-ray,
it's kind of like 2.4 days of background.

03d4ceae-5d83-4e41-b1bb-db7d37f94530-0
00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:14.920
When it goes into a chastity, it's like 2.
7 years of radiation background.

ea83f794-f98e-4deb-9780-455815b9cae3-0
00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:19.880
And also as you see the abdomen is 3.
2 years of background.

ca9eda2a-c7dd-4307-8696-fff71fc1c8e8-0
00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:23.200
So it's pretty easy to to compare having
those concerts.

2d1eb9cb-e82a-459f-9674-c27ac2faee6a-0
00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:32.271
Occupation of those affected limits is is
is crucial to review these limits so

2d1eb9cb-e82a-459f-9674-c27ac2faee6a-1
00:20:32.271 --> 00:20:37.960
everybody in the room or in the lab knows
how effective your readings are.

6c037952-69d2-44c9-b4b4-83f16e3d2fae-0
00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:42.173
It's,
it's crucial to know the numbers as as we

6c037952-69d2-44c9-b4b4-83f16e3d2fae-1
00:20:42.173 --> 00:20:46.201
spoke about it,
especially when you have someone a female

6c037952-69d2-44c9-b4b4-83f16e3d2fae-2
00:20:46.201 --> 00:20:50.298
during pregnancy,
we should take care of those numbers and

6c037952-69d2-44c9-b4b4-83f16e3d2fae-3
00:20:50.298 --> 00:20:53.840
know how much radiation are they,
They're exposed.

1e71ffb0-6c19-416e-870b-db57e95b5752-0
00:20:56.600 --> 00:21:01.296
As you see in this graph,
radiation exposure for healthcare workers

1e71ffb0-6c19-416e-870b-db57e95b5752-1
00:21:01.296 --> 00:21:05.855
in the in the procedure room is directly
link it to patient dose,

1e71ffb0-6c19-416e-870b-db57e95b5752-2
00:21:05.855 --> 00:21:08.480
A scatter radiation at distance of 1m.

2cebe57e-9952-4a49-b663-6c42da70a501-0
00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:13.698
The personnel will receive 0.
1% of the patient dose due to a scatter

2cebe57e-9952-4a49-b663-6c42da70a501-1
00:21:13.698 --> 00:21:19.320
radiation with a minor contribution from
X-ray leakage through the tube housing.

2e774c2d-253a-4ee4-b5f3-43207208d354-0
00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:25.355
Also,
as you see the picture on the right side,

2e774c2d-253a-4ee4-b5f3-43207208d354-1
00:21:25.355 --> 00:21:30.867
when you're pretty close to the tube,
that's when a major radiation exposure

2e774c2d-253a-4ee4-b5f3-43207208d354-2
00:21:30.867 --> 00:21:31.440
happens.

2dfb9376-4228-4b13-bddb-c66a258c5a7b-0
00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:34.918
So we have to be aware when performing
lateral abuse,

2dfb9376-4228-4b13-bddb-c66a258c5a7b-1
00:21:34.918 --> 00:21:37.560
try to keep everyone away from that area.

ff8a52cf-e427-4873-84e1-dcfe649edeb3-0
00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:49.790
How do we measure the amount of radiation
we're supposed to?

19a5be56-addb-4a4f-801c-9adb329d27b7-0
00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:52.350
Well, basically using dosimeters.

4681ce2c-19c1-4c38-8fe8-f6320bf07f6c-0
00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:58.077
We should always wear a dosimeter over
the lead Efron typical at the neck or the

4681ce2c-19c1-4c38-8fe8-f6320bf07f6c-1
00:21:58.077 --> 00:21:58.790
torso level.

f1511856-607d-43ba-9681-ceeac35eca7b-0
00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:04.317
Usually it's only as pretty specific for
for the person,

f1511856-607d-43ba-9681-ceeac35eca7b-1
00:22:04.317 --> 00:22:07.680
so you should not share the dosimeter at
all.

cb57529b-1a8f-4e82-ac8f-2e8246775569-0
00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:16.552
And it's linked to your Social Security,
so it's the only way they can ensure

cb57529b-1a8f-4e82-ac8f-2e8246775569-1
00:22:16.552 --> 00:22:22.120
accurate tracking for individual creation
exposure,

cb57529b-1a8f-4e82-ac8f-2e8246775569-2
00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:26.190
practical dose reduction for patients.

235060f0-b540-4cba-ae40-adf713801e98-0
00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:30.513
We should always,
always lower the frame rates,

235060f0-b540-4cba-ae40-adf713801e98-1
00:22:30.513 --> 00:22:36.678
make sure we have a tight collimation to
a specific area and be aware of the

235060f0-b540-4cba-ae40-adf713801e98-2
00:22:36.678 --> 00:22:38.520
timing every 5 minutes.

342b8ef4-2e9c-47e7-98fb-f89611d9889d-0
00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:42.440
So someone in the room should kind of
like be tracking how many minutes of

342b8ef4-2e9c-47e7-98fb-f89611d9889d-1
00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:43.800
fluor you have been using.

983aed48-364f-4339-a766-ff1e1b6cb2a2-0
00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:47.240
So we we can keep that to the lowest
timing.

dfb88f32-af4f-4067-9777-3a1871a078a7-0
00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:54.410
Also minimizing DSA runs or a scene and
how that's how it's going calf lab and

dfb88f32-af4f-4067-9777-3a1871a078a7-1
00:22:54.410 --> 00:22:56.480
avoid like heavy angles.

47b310c5-ba07-4f75-8fc0-eaa9121e7cb9-0
00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:00.689
That's,
that's pretty important for to keep the

47b310c5-ba07-4f75-8fc0-eaa9121e7cb9-1
00:23:00.689 --> 00:23:01.800
radiation low.

15d27a7a-739c-4aeb-b66a-09e984bf1614-0
00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:08.751
What we can do is,
is usually making sure everybody is

15d27a7a-739c-4aeb-b66a-09e984bf1614-1
00:23:08.751 --> 00:23:15.597
wearing apron tire colour, leg glasses,
the batches for sure if you're doing DSA,

15d27a7a-739c-4aeb-b66a-09e984bf1614-2
00:23:15.597 --> 00:23:20.440
you'll see me step away, you know,
away from the patient.

12fc488c-72ca-46e6-8b07-01b3e53c6a05-0
00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:25.480
So you can, you know,
be in a safe area where no radiation is

12fc488c-72ca-46e6-8b07-01b3e53c6a05-1
00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:27.920
reaching to, to the personnel.

72af2996-4d15-4091-8fc1-08f3f57ff9f5-0
00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:35.430
This is a survey,
this is a pretty busy slide,

72af2996-4d15-4091-8fc1-08f3f57ff9f5-1
00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:40.857
but it's crucial because it shows the
different results from a survey done by

72af2996-4d15-4091-8fc1-08f3f57ff9f5-2
00:23:40.857 --> 00:23:45.520
the Society of Cardiovascular and
Angiography and Interventionals.

1fd9fa75-7f28-454a-87c6-ee26b8b261c7-0
00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:49.824
This is this one was done in 2023 and it
shows the, the,

1fd9fa75-7f28-454a-87c6-ee26b8b261c7-1
00:23:49.824 --> 00:23:53.525
the average and in percentage it's,
it's pretty,

1fd9fa75-7f28-454a-87c6-ee26b8b261c7-2
00:23:53.525 --> 00:23:56.320
I mean those numbers are pretty high.

9d87e68c-5ecd-42e3-8471-19890b4b1ed3-0
00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:01.900
If you see a pregnancy 28 percent,
71% when it comes into radiation,

9d87e68c-5ecd-42e3-8471-19890b4b1ed3-1
00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:03.440
6% related to cancer.

5455e98a-9add-4ac4-a916-054708f26ebf-0
00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:07.360
When it comes to orthopedic,
those numbers are pretty high.

3ebd55c8-9cd4-4d99-885e-a59888ebeb2c-0
00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:15.120
So we should be pretty taking care of
this 66 percent, 34 and 25.

03f6359c-bf9a-432b-9fcb-045856f1febc-0
00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:28.397
When it comes to new technology LED free
solutions are kind of like in the

03f6359c-bf9a-432b-9fcb-045856f1febc-1
00:24:28.397 --> 00:24:29.160
evolution.

60129933-b9ab-4628-bce3-304319831848-0
00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:35.237
So this I would say this in the infancy,
but there's a lot of significant

60129933-b9ab-4628-bce3-304319831848-1
00:24:35.237 --> 00:24:41.228
potential in this area when properly set
up for a procedure can be performed

60129933-b9ab-4628-bce3-304319831848-2
00:24:41.228 --> 00:24:42.240
without laps.

6d4c8f6b-6f2c-4b8f-93a6-7827b547c962-0
00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:46.002
You know, I think that's,
that's the what we're going to see,

6d4c8f6b-6f2c-4b8f-93a6-7827b547c962-1
00:24:46.002 --> 00:24:47.320
you know, in the future.

45017f64-336c-424a-b9f4-b92127b540d4-0
00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:50.640
And also,
I know there's a few states already and

45017f64-336c-424a-b9f4-b92127b540d4-1
00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:53.400
hospitals that they're using this
technology.

51981ace-f29f-4ca4-a80e-5b84bc7de426-0
00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:56.760
And I think this is, this is the future.

02f49a4e-588b-40a4-aa0b-df9029d24832-0
00:24:57.240 --> 00:25:01.480
So this is important to adapt to these
changes.

c9ff4e0b-7b36-4e43-8c8c-37adfe839b28-0
00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:07.370
And of course, like all new technologies,
there's pros and cons, you know,

c9ff4e0b-7b36-4e43-8c8c-37adfe839b28-1
00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:10.400
set up time,
proper education for the staff.

8abe4a6e-a000-4172-b3d2-7ec51d03986b-0
00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:13.040
But I think this,
this is where we're going.

d10d08e1-cae9-416d-8d89-69300f0b5fb1-0
00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:24.542
As a summary, we can talk about, you know,
always keep your timing distance and

d10d08e1-cae9-416d-8d89-69300f0b5fb1-1
00:25:24.542 --> 00:25:25.160
shielding.

f15c1c9c-d613-47c4-8554-9f0ffa0f02e6-0
00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:26.880
Try to be aware of that.

ab41cbba-19d7-4a29-a671-5864f5ebe2a9-0
00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:28.720
Follow the Alara as low as possible.

8792d2ee-faa5-4b54-a0f1-f3376b38053d-0
00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:34.480
Just be aware that the scatter that's
that's the why you need to be careful.

f91f5832-95ea-4a00-b7db-367dc71d1f56-0
00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:41.888
Always use the DAP those area product as
as your information for every case and we

f91f5832-95ea-4a00-b7db-367dc71d1f56-1
00:25:41.888 --> 00:25:44.720
need to adapt to the new technology.

30eb39f3-cb1b-4b24-b969-6c0a8556850f-0
00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:50.400
This is what is going to make the
difference and avoiding issues in the lab.

f2a616e7-9d12-4559-a4b3-d8469d574473-0
00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:56.520
If you have any questions,
please feel free and thank you for your

f2a616e7-9d12-4559-a4b3-d8469d574473-1
00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:57.040
attention.

a4599e01-67a0-402b-a3e7-074b7a2e7532-0
00:25:58.360 --> 00:25:59.400
OK, welcome back everybody.

37818925-73b3-455d-87ab-7f7fd55efa1b-0
00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:01.440
And we saved the best for last.

ffdd83e9-91bc-4855-8bdf-7edbbf3bd122-0
00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:05.320
I think this this last round panel is
going to be fantastic.

43c091da-fbae-42c2-bbb1-7455f274c871-0
00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:09.320
We've got a really star standard group,
a lot of experience on this panel.

b529f43d-12be-43d0-bd1a-49c4689ca2c0-0
00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:14.231
Looking forward to discussing some of the
hot topics and and really kind of bring

b529f43d-12be-43d0-bd1a-49c4689ca2c0-1
00:26:14.231 --> 00:26:17.765
them down to earth,
figure out how we're going to do this,

b529f43d-12be-43d0-bd1a-49c4689ca2c0-2
00:26:17.765 --> 00:26:20.760
how, how,
how can we help and make some change in

b529f43d-12be-43d0-bd1a-49c4689ca2c0-3
00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:21.240
the lab.

4a447a4c-4565-4b9e-ad77-1cf3727aabfb-0
00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:25.046
Keep in mind you can ask questions and
hopefully we'll get those questions

4a447a4c-4565-4b9e-ad77-1cf3727aabfb-1
00:26:25.046 --> 00:26:25.560
during this.

3bc2154a-6b79-4904-a81e-8723de5ad3d3-0
00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:31.000
They are here to answer your questions
and so you know, please, please reach out.

1c6c8b80-e5fe-4e5d-8d93-85e3d7172b8c-0
00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:37.520
Those last two talks by the technologist
I thought were, were really fantastic.

51c9f535-742f-4ecb-b6cb-bcaa6477df75-0
00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:41.582
They did a great job and and now we're
going to kind of bring it home with

51c9f535-742f-4ecb-b6cb-bcaa6477df75-1
00:26:41.582 --> 00:26:45.320
asking some questions hopefully that
everybody really wants to know.

02bbbe94-2732-46ba-9732-d70a6a35d966-0
00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:47.280
On the panel.

8123ef74-fb11-47c6-ad41-23c0cbb8f046-0
00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:51.920
We got doctor Lakshmanarian from from
Yorkshire.

001af702-3722-4f77-8994-c995fe47b096-0
00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:55.000
He is a interventional vascular
radiologist.

56e8d2b6-552a-436a-90bc-beb966915a1e-0
00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:59.400
We've got Doctor Gandhi from Miami and
then conventional radiologists.

1d7bab9f-ea08-4515-a721-ff1f87de3dd1-0
00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:05.640
We have Doctor Pat Muck is back with us
as a chief vascular surgeon in Ohio.

45389d2f-2bd9-423f-88ef-d637930ed6a9-0
00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:08.600
Chris Steelman has joined us.

eb18679b-c0a0-4aa3-bf7a-477b934abd45-0
00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:15.323
He is a assistant professor at Weber
State University and leads and guides a

eb18679b-c0a0-4aa3-bf7a-477b934abd45-1
00:27:15.323 --> 00:27:19.160
lot of the technology schools and
education.

c2eb0672-2bfb-474f-930f-5f8efc51806f-0
00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:20.160
And then Dr.

9a166a26-91bb-4330-8950-224b1ed6ab7b-0
00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:24.600
Ana Saito,
who is also interventional cardiologist

9a166a26-91bb-4330-8950-224b1ed6ab7b-1
00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:26.080
in San Francisco.

8f91d382-0c61-40c7-8640-f4770725f436-0
00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:31.841
Doctor her Miller is also with us as past
president of Sky and we'll also be back

8f91d382-0c61-40c7-8640-f4770725f436-1
00:27:31.841 --> 00:27:37.040
tomorrow with with some of the other
panelists as well from Indianapolis.

0669d369-00d0-4cb1-997f-e6577ff4999f-0
00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:40.693
So with that,
I really think it's going to it's going

0669d369-00d0-4cb1-997f-e6577ff4999f-1
00:27:40.693 --> 00:27:46.240
to be really exciting to kind of figure
out what we need to do here as we kind of

0669d369-00d0-4cb1-997f-e6577ff4999f-2
00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:47.120
move forward.

3165f5cc-b0fb-44c8-965a-ca0528b8bd2d-0
00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:52.210
I guess one of the one of the things that
kind of keeps coming up is should we,

3165f5cc-b0fb-44c8-965a-ca0528b8bd2d-1
00:27:52.210 --> 00:27:56.862
when we walk into a room and I don't know
what it's like in it at your place,

3165f5cc-b0fb-44c8-965a-ca0528b8bd2d-2
00:27:56.862 --> 00:28:00.440
but but should we have a typical
radiation safety time out?

db6dba1e-9464-4f51-8505-51554016c401-0
00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:04.652
And if we have a radiation safety time
out to decide, you know,

db6dba1e-9464-4f51-8505-51554016c401-1
00:28:04.652 --> 00:28:08.320
are the people in their LED,
what part of the room can be LED free?

dc30c159-8700-4237-89be-591e4093fbd6-0
00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:09.920
What part of the room can be light lead?

f79ba7c7-cd7e-4c62-8f26-b93305ab6487-0
00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:16.271
What kind of procedures are we doing that
require a heavier weight lead and making

f79ba7c7-cd7e-4c62-8f26-b93305ab6487-1
00:28:16.271 --> 00:28:18.480
all those, all those decisions?

6dd5f91f-3e00-4ef6-b782-0bf2cceada43-0
00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:24.365
So how do we navigate that as we move
into some of these barrier technologies

6dd5f91f-3e00-4ef6-b782-0bf2cceada43-1
00:28:24.365 --> 00:28:28.859
that use varying degrees of lead aprons
and, or no aprons and,

6dd5f91f-3e00-4ef6-b782-0bf2cceada43-2
00:28:28.859 --> 00:28:32.712
and still in the variation of not only
your position,

6dd5f91f-3e00-4ef6-b782-0bf2cceada43-3
00:28:32.712 --> 00:28:36.279
but but the type of procedures that
you're doing.

1c5f292b-129f-4510-9917-a0612f6e64af-0
00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:38.982
So open,
open that up to the panel and we can can

1c5f292b-129f-4510-9917-a0612f6e64af-1
00:28:38.982 --> 00:28:40.280
kind of start out there.

6e5384dd-afed-48a7-a74e-3c1e6fbd7597-0
00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:46.440
I'd be happy to jump in.

e1e922b6-e313-4fe2-8d37-5cc5595130b3-0
00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:52.150
I heard that earlier today, Doctor,
and I was amazed that we hadn't been

e1e922b6-e313-4fe2-8d37-5cc5595130b3-1
00:28:52.150 --> 00:28:53.080
doing it already.

6deec6f1-39f6-4790-b758-0cfc08e66b3e-0
00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:54.880
I mean, it just makes sense.

ed163ac8-9627-4842-bab5-502fb3c96341-0
00:28:55.120 --> 00:29:00.015
And not not only should we be talking
about the particular challenges of the

ed163ac8-9627-4842-bab5-502fb3c96341-1
00:29:00.015 --> 00:29:05.164
case from that perspective, but you know,
any notes that could be provided to us

ed163ac8-9627-4842-bab5-502fb3c96341-2
00:29:05.164 --> 00:29:08.280
because you're right,
we're setting up the room.

111eec54-f3a4-4353-8725-50c0a4add482-0
00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:11.480
And I'm speaking as a Cath lab radiologic
technologist.

d96e7cae-42f2-4475-8997-1fb69ad7e057-0
00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:14.200
We're setting up the room for you.

feadeb14-3d08-41dd-bfe2-c16ed9be5d4b-0
00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:18.867
And so to have that information
communicated beforehand gives us a head

feadeb14-3d08-41dd-bfe2-c16ed9be5d4b-1
00:29:18.867 --> 00:29:19.200
start.

32d28c48-055e-478f-889b-49638f435e8a-0
00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:20.360
Do we need the ramp?

e2a8dd7e-e3ad-489c-a08e-8f97f3269b54-0
00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:23.280
Do we need this or that approach to this?

efbca8ad-33bb-473a-b044-6cec02a24690-0
00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:26.926
But also during that time out mentioning,
you know,

efbca8ad-33bb-473a-b044-6cec02a24690-1
00:29:26.926 --> 00:29:30.954
here's here's not only the challenges,
but let's remind ourselves,

efbca8ad-33bb-473a-b044-6cec02a24690-2
00:29:30.954 --> 00:29:33.840
we're going to keep the IR down on the
patient.

25fd99b0-84c1-4ba1-a5ec-f2a84adedee6-0
00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:35.160
We want that table high.

ebf583c3-1760-45f5-9c31-4017a7d849d0-0
00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:37.160
We're going to optimize table geometry.

0a2a00f8-72b1-470f-9005-7e971660e22b-0
00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:41.760
And I was a little upset I didn't think
of that.

357cfd71-2609-4372-a210-43447595baf8-0
00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:44.600
So, yeah, I, I took plenty of doubts.

f351d04b-f035-437f-b3df-06a7ab857a0e-0
00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:46.240
So I think it's a great idea.

7c4bd164-ac9d-40bb-8e31-48296115cd10-0
00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:53.174
Yeah, I, I think if Bob,
if I can go from the UK, that that is a,

7c4bd164-ac9d-40bb-8e31-48296115cd10-1
00:29:53.174 --> 00:29:59.378
that is a brilliant suggestion because
one of the key things we surveyed lots of

7c4bd164-ac9d-40bb-8e31-48296115cd10-2
00:29:59.378 --> 00:30:00.679
people in the UK.

5999fcee-3c3b-493d-855e-328b97b7f8c7-0
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.007
So if you take orthopedic surgeons,
you know, you know,

5999fcee-3c3b-493d-855e-328b97b7f8c7-1
00:30:05.007 --> 00:30:08.657
you shift focus to other people who use
radiation,

5999fcee-3c3b-493d-855e-328b97b7f8c7-2
00:30:08.657 --> 00:30:11.948
even wearing on monitoring devices,
you know,

5999fcee-3c3b-493d-855e-328b97b7f8c7-3
00:30:11.948 --> 00:30:17.960
50% of the consultants wear on monitoring
devices, even though everyone is given 1.

2f02606f-8da6-4315-9353-5cff7746d33f-0
00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:21.680
And when it comes to the trainees,
it falls to 23%.

992b7e63-bf7b-4456-9bf8-483b0f6e0a9a-0
00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:26.063
Just that idea of saying, you know,
you have a time out where you're asking

992b7e63-bf7b-4456-9bf8-483b0f6e0a9a-1
00:30:26.063 --> 00:30:29.240
have you, have, have you,
do you have your device with you?

ff3cf3f8-2b11-4661-9d4f-4e7ee92036a2-0
00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:33.560
And Patrick might be interested in this.

78c902eb-1cc4-4701-abea-e4d8738c1fa3-0
00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:38.395
You know,
80% of vascular surgeons are provided who,

78c902eb-1cc4-4701-abea-e4d8738c1fa3-1
00:30:38.395 --> 00:30:43.960
who have devices end up only only about
70% of them wear it.

840b8a57-4677-4985-973e-d5ea1e3c608e-0
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.184
And when it comes to trainees in vascular
surgery,

840b8a57-4677-4985-973e-d5ea1e3c608e-1
00:30:47.184 --> 00:30:50.120
only 30% of them end up wearing these
devices.

5c2bb1b6-06d9-47ec-bca9-1b332e41a793-0
00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:55.680
So just a, just a time out to say, hey,
do you have your device on?

ff829e5e-62fc-42b6-a419-33ecdce2e8d9-0
00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:58.400
Is, is, is a simple, but great question.

0d02bbe3-5951-42cf-b6fd-36d4cf48a09e-0
00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:03.480
I think some of our surveys have shown
that it's, it's a bit dismal.

e1716b9d-9ead-4798-94cb-39c12d81bdfb-0
00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:07.280
I'm going to kind of, you know, challenge,
you know, this is something that,

e1716b9d-9ead-4798-94cb-39c12d81bdfb-1
00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:08.560
you know, we talked about a lot.

b4ad9c56-6bd2-4968-b3df-790eb2163422-0
00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:12.192
And one of the counterpoints that I've
heard from our trainees as well as,

b4ad9c56-6bd2-4968-b3df-790eb2163422-1
00:31:12.192 --> 00:31:14.498
you know,
a lot of our staff physicians is what do

b4ad9c56-6bd2-4968-b3df-790eb2163422-2
00:31:14.498 --> 00:31:15.720
I do with that information?

c5054363-31bd-463b-9fc6-7522da134107-0
00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:17.640
OK, I have the badge on.

6fa0138c-5a7c-4dd0-a15b-8075bb0b731b-0
00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:21.520
When is that information even conveyed to
the physician?

2a72a8c9-01c8-4f66-a2c8-a4ab06668c0f-0
00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:22.760
Is it conveyed at all?

8960fbcb-73e9-4402-af83-5647d3def86a-0
00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:25.640
And, and when I get those numbers,
what does it mean?

5d200506-1071-41a6-a8fd-a607c0d2c084-0
00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.360
And as a trainee, I've heard trainees say,
well, I don't want to miss out on cases.

2fc348bc-12ad-4831-86a5-a460ed9d8bf1-0
00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:33.622
So, you know, if we're going to,
if we're going to mandate that or

2fc348bc-12ad-4831-86a5-a460ed9d8bf1-1
00:31:33.622 --> 00:31:37.405
recommend, you know, doing that,
I didn't really need to institute

2fc348bc-12ad-4831-86a5-a460ed9d8bf1-2
00:31:37.405 --> 00:31:41.696
measures on #1 education #2 you know,
how if your doses are getting high to

2fc348bc-12ad-4831-86a5-a460ed9d8bf1-3
00:31:41.696 --> 00:31:45.196
actually, you know,
what are ways that we could actually make

2fc348bc-12ad-4831-86a5-a460ed9d8bf1-4
00:31:45.196 --> 00:31:48.866
them within the, you know,
appropriate range such that we're not

2fc348bc-12ad-4831-86a5-a460ed9d8bf1-5
00:31:48.866 --> 00:31:50.560
eliminating people from cases.

a7be522e-93c8-4b8f-85a8-500ff9df826d-0
00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:55.301
But if we just mandate people wearing
badges without actually having any

a7be522e-93c8-4b8f-85a8-500ff9df826d-1
00:31:55.301 --> 00:31:57.920
further plan,
I don't think it's very valuable.

1eeb295d-45b3-4543-9514-c94bdb8fea60-0
00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:02.514
I'll be the first to admit I was one of
those who did not wear my badge because I

1eeb295d-45b3-4543-9514-c94bdb8fea60-1
00:32:02.514 --> 00:32:05.320
didn't keep exceeding my limits,
which is a terrible, a terrible thing.

e7c315fa-9f98-4683-8dea-379d5a0700e3-0
00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:07.120
And we shouldn't be in that situation.

ac42c885-b250-482b-bf56-5e5be9245474-0
00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:11.734
And I'm glad it's not happening just in
the US because the number here are just

ac42c885-b250-482b-bf56-5e5be9245474-1
00:32:11.734 --> 00:32:15.492
like you were talking about is, you know,
it's probably about 70% or,

ac42c885-b250-482b-bf56-5e5be9245474-2
00:32:15.492 --> 00:32:17.639
or 50% that aren't wearing their badges.

4d4031b8-c6a9-4221-87bb-969359e2d496-0
00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:20.860
And so, you know, again, we need to,
we need to raise that level of,

4d4031b8-c6a9-4221-87bb-969359e2d496-1
00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:22.120
of that it's safe to do it.

db916ed8-5d7e-48a5-b22a-dcf0942399bf-0
00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:25.000
And you understand, like you say,
you understand what the numbers mean.

093483fa-12f7-496e-b170-4e223002f372-0
00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:29.510
And I think real time does symmetry might
help with that as we start getting into a

093483fa-12f7-496e-b170-4e223002f372-1
00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:32.704
little bit more active,
real time does symmetry to be so people

093483fa-12f7-496e-b170-4e223002f372-2
00:32:32.704 --> 00:32:34.600
know what those numbers actually mean.

6d3339f8-8b0c-453e-ac3d-b45adbe17f87-0
00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:35.360
Yeah.

0b4531eb-e760-453f-b340-6e06da4a7b0b-0
00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:37.000
Reg, you, I can't agree enough.

802e02bf-67d4-4e65-8210-9e5b0d835c08-0
00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.640
I want to just challenge your numbers.

dfc3ba38-3da7-4abe-9399-99e96cc8396e-0
00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:43.280
You know, here at Cincinnati,
there's six of us.

d78f039b-16ee-42d3-b97b-694999cfb763-0
00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:44.000
You know, there's not.

b947c058-8ae3-4782-8470-c5d3cec17a06-0
00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:50.914
We've got 35 cardiology partners and I'm
not proud to say that all six of us don't

b947c058-8ae3-4782-8470-c5d3cec17a06-1
00:32:50.914 --> 00:32:51.880
wear badges.

69aa95f8-d86e-4a51-831d-70dc129c6c39-0
00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:53.000
It's it's embarrassing.

30048778-5f99-46d1-9a66-8d39cf628b31-0
00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:54.560
So we're at 100%.

a4d87f52-dad4-4211-a794-e692be7cd67c-0
00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:57.896
So we we've already got you beat over
here in Ohio,

a4d87f52-dad4-4211-a794-e692be7cd67c-1
00:32:57.896 --> 00:33:01.040
but obviously it's not a laughing matter
at all.

202791e8-7821-48e4-b51f-a6ce3713db03-0
00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:02.240
It's it's embarrassing.

a13273a4-ad9e-4c77-b86f-5d3710c1ec35-0
00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:07.526
And I agree with with Repo when you got,
we need education and the Society of

a13273a4-ad9e-4c77-b86f-5d3710c1ec35-1
00:33:07.526 --> 00:33:10.576
Vascular Surgery is woefully behind in
this,

a13273a4-ad9e-4c77-b86f-5d3710c1ec35-2
00:33:10.576 --> 00:33:15.116
as we typically are when it comes to
minimally invasive, you know,

a13273a4-ad9e-4c77-b86f-5d3710c1ec35-3
00:33:15.116 --> 00:33:17.760
therapies and procedures and education.

246d2707-6d53-4615-8683-d3e4c1c6732e-0
00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:21.520
We're always way behind the, the,
the IC and the IR world.

5a7f7f94-ede4-4e4b-a134-b1e1a74c4726-0
00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:26.595
And so at least from our perspective, our,
our trainees are taking it seriously and

5a7f7f94-ede4-4e4b-a134-b1e1a74c4726-1
00:33:26.595 --> 00:33:29.200
we're trying to put out a survey to get
data.

da6da862-0a6b-4dfb-beda-574df084768b-0
00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:32.766
And I might reach out to you,
if you don't mind Ragu to get your input

da6da862-0a6b-4dfb-beda-574df084768b-1
00:33:32.766 --> 00:33:35.880
to the Association of Program Directors
and Vascular surgery.

c77038a2-519d-4cfc-8437-0ec2070bed3a-0
00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:40.344
We're going to send out, you know,
a 20 question survey about all the things

c77038a2-519d-4cfc-8437-0ec2070bed3a-1
00:33:40.344 --> 00:33:43.800
you guys are all talking about to the
trainees in the country.

71e68e4d-515e-4644-850d-c1564d4fe564-0
00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:47.162
And I would,
I bet it's going to be very woeful the

71e68e4d-515e-4644-850d-c1564d4fe564-1
00:33:47.162 --> 00:33:47.680
results.

954d4d70-1753-4346-8986-27b1587273a9-0
00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:50.200
I like this.

39e728dd-ebad-41a0-bf51-1661028754eb-0
00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:52.592
I like the aspect honestly more than that,
you know,

39e728dd-ebad-41a0-bf51-1661028754eb-1
00:33:52.592 --> 00:33:56.204
wearing the radiation badge and which is
fine if we're going to educate people,

39e728dd-ebad-41a0-bf51-1661028754eb-2
00:33:56.204 --> 00:33:59.726
but more in terms of very basic things
that we should be doing during case of

39e728dd-ebad-41a0-bf51-1661028754eb-3
00:33:59.726 --> 00:34:01.577
look,
maybe you don't have some of these

39e728dd-ebad-41a0-bf51-1661028754eb-4
00:34:01.577 --> 00:34:03.880
advanced radiation protection systems in
your lab.

d416d821-b223-475d-9049-d933407d7755-0
00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:08.275
And I would venture at this point in time,
the vast majority probably do not,

d416d821-b223-475d-9049-d933407d7755-1
00:34:08.275 --> 00:34:12.952
but just very basic things that honestly
drive me crazy every day when I'm looking

d416d821-b223-475d-9049-d933407d7755-2
00:34:12.952 --> 00:34:14.080
at our our trainees.

68931800-a0d8-4522-89c1-87de6d551d8c-0
00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:18.280
I mean, lower the I, I use the, use the,
you know, portable shield.

8e430bcd-ac24-4387-8ab7-9b958e3ee331-0
00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:19.840
Make sure you have the skirt on the table.

72d134f5-c62d-4383-9b00-6648b6f61648-0
00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:23.551
Just very basic things, which, you know,
if we mentioned that as a part of the

72d134f5-c62d-4383-9b00-6648b6f61648-1
00:34:23.551 --> 00:34:25.760
time out,
I think would be extremely valuable.

f00588ea-c96d-4a5d-909e-3b649dd6cbe2-0
00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:27.240
All right, Doctor Harveller.

fe748ed4-4f38-4abc-b9f2-82df607072bf-0
00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:28.280
Yeah.

c12d286e-a960-49a1-afa2-6205d08b77aa-0
00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:32.520
But I think it's a brilliant idea to have
a time out right now.

a18e9d89-e423-47c4-8801-23fea7a3f2ae-0
00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:33.320
Our time out.

76bf745e-6817-47b3-87cf-cc388c3c7e25-0
00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:40.240
Looks like we lost Doctor.

abd417c4-3ae3-4195-a1cf-9b17a4603eab-0
00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:40.800
I know that.

2d54b1ca-2c57-44d0-844a-817b8b46c527-0
00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:43.974
Doctor Sedo,
you had a question or you had your hand

2d54b1ca-2c57-44d0-844a-817b8b46c527-1
00:34:43.974 --> 00:34:44.120
up.

63c83724-064f-4d0d-96f3-666114467d6f-0
00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:44.880
Yeah.

cac72dec-2517-488d-960f-76c2a566e8da-0
00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:48.271
So since we lost Doctor Henry, yeah,
I'll comment that we actually,

cac72dec-2517-488d-960f-76c2a566e8da-1
00:34:48.271 --> 00:34:50.714
we actually tried the adding it to the
time out,

cac72dec-2517-488d-960f-76c2a566e8da-2
00:34:50.714 --> 00:34:52.560
but it really needs to be actionable.

a8feac25-ddc1-4a57-b408-ec6945db98bb-0
00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:56.400
The time out is already burdened by Jayco
requirements like fire risk, site marking.

401444d6-4a9c-4fd9-8d81-f2ba8953fd0d-0
00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:58.320
It becomes meaningless unless it's
actionable.

13e58037-24e3-455d-8718-206f667e4d36-0
00:34:58.320 --> 00:34:59.960
So I definitely agree with recall about
that.

ca03d3bc-a3f1-4ddd-aaa5-ed594e7b3e70-0
00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:04.045
You know, we do say that, you know,
we're all wearing our radiation badges

ca03d3bc-a3f1-4ddd-aaa5-ed594e7b3e70-1
00:35:04.045 --> 00:35:06.616
because that's the one thing that is
actionable and, and,

ca03d3bc-a3f1-4ddd-aaa5-ed594e7b3e70-2
00:35:06.616 --> 00:35:08.080
and things doesn't always happen.

024ec628-1c3a-4537-b61e-48ab37ec3299-0
00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:11.016
But for most of our cardiac cases,
you know, we set up the Portego,

024ec628-1c3a-4537-b61e-48ab37ec3299-1
00:35:11.016 --> 00:35:12.200
everyone's protected equally.

2c4f83ea-3402-44b3-abcd-2c3ed325f876-0
00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:15.141
The rain, you know, the,
the exposure is the same because we're

2c4f83ea-3402-44b3-abcd-2c3ed325f876-1
00:35:15.141 --> 00:35:16.520
all staying behind the shield.

63560e9b-ae05-4e76-b15b-fecb64a245f5-0
00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:20.093
So unless there's something different,
like there's ATE probe going in someone

63560e9b-ae05-4e76-b15b-fecb64a245f5-1
00:35:20.093 --> 00:35:22.211
there,
then I think that's where the variability

63560e9b-ae05-4e76-b15b-fecb64a245f5-2
00:35:22.211 --> 00:35:22.600
comes in.

c9378c11-f6e5-469d-9c2c-58386464ceb1-0
00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:24.320
That's when a time out is most helpful.

3b6a0a8d-ef3d-4ed3-a10a-6e6a95190065-0
00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:27.720
Otherwise it becomes a,
a burden and becomes less meaningful.

e48481f2-e7e6-4020-99e5-de319e1c2405-0
00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:32.523
But it'd be nice upfront to know like who
is on the other side of the barrier to

e48481f2-e7e6-4020-99e5-de319e1c2405-1
00:35:32.523 --> 00:35:34.920
say, OK,
we're going to have anesthesia up there.

c5de78b1-3f45-40af-8796-0ad8e7532e47-0
00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:38.640
We're going to have a, you know,
an echo cardiographer up there.

8eeac4a0-ba36-4063-b675-2b6c3f18c3bd-0
00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:41.961
So again, making sure that, you know,
they're in whatever they need to be

8eeac4a0-ba36-4063-b675-2b6c3f18c3bd-1
00:35:41.961 --> 00:35:44.408
appropriate for,
for whatever kind of shielding they have

8eeac4a0-ba36-4063-b675-2b6c3f18c3bd-2
00:35:44.408 --> 00:35:45.800
at the head of the table as well.

d0a0041c-28c2-4994-98e1-ab3eaaa77ff3-0
00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:50.828
Raghu, just a quick point to say,
in the UK,

d0a0041c-28c2-4994-98e1-ab3eaaa77ff3-1
00:35:50.828 --> 00:35:55.943
you have the medical physics department
who analyzes these badges and it's

d0a0041c-28c2-4994-98e1-ab3eaaa77ff3-2
00:35:55.943 --> 00:36:00.103
mandated that an e-mail goes out to say
ripple to say, look,

d0a0041c-28c2-4994-98e1-ab3eaaa77ff3-3
00:36:00.103 --> 00:36:04.400
this is at the end of the month,
This is your radiation level.

c484ba1d-4684-4bbc-a903-a320e0ecab15-0
00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:08.545
And even though you don't know what the
radiation level is, it's, it's,

c484ba1d-4684-4bbc-a903-a320e0ecab15-1
00:36:08.545 --> 00:36:11.787
it's an interesting thing because I tend
to look at it from,

c484ba1d-4684-4bbc-a903-a320e0ecab15-2
00:36:11.787 --> 00:36:15.560
from my colleague and say, Hey,
why is mine double that that person's?

0ec0dc7b-d894-4b78-8d84-c00c2dc0a00c-0
00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:18.640
And then it,
it starts getting you thinking on it.

0e3c00c0-8271-476e-90e0-588f5709aa17-0
00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:24.459
The other thing that we're working on
which kind of leads into your time out is

0e3c00c0-8271-476e-90e0-588f5709aa17-1
00:36:24.459 --> 00:36:29.560
we're trying to look at buttonology as to
who is going to press that button.

a3c72c41-57ba-42ac-8d4c-39f825ec86c2-0
00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:35.259
Is that going to be the consultant who is
Ripple or is it going to be Chris as a,

a3c72c41-57ba-42ac-8d4c-39f825ec86c2-1
00:36:35.259 --> 00:36:38.881
as a, you know,
radiography person And the person who

a3c72c41-57ba-42ac-8d4c-39f825ec86c2-2
00:36:38.881 --> 00:36:44.113
presses the button actually has to kind
of take responsibility of getting the

a3c72c41-57ba-42ac-8d4c-39f825ec86c2-3
00:36:44.113 --> 00:36:47.400
intensifier low enough to the patient,
etcetera.

e2a122b8-b856-4f8c-9027-9e50d08efd2a-0
00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:51.922
So we're trying to develop this
buttonology and try and pin down on who

e2a122b8-b856-4f8c-9027-9e50d08efd2a-1
00:36:51.922 --> 00:36:55.680
is going to press that button that's
going to emit those X-rays.

e7923047-25f8-4a91-af77-e188d17ed555-0
00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.347
And they will have to have a set guidance
of what they'll have to adhere to,

e7923047-25f8-4a91-af77-e188d17ed555-1
00:37:00.347 --> 00:37:04.920
to try and reduce the amount of radiation
to the various people around the room.

4222357e-86ca-40c5-92ea-298194629ba4-0
00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:07.240
We've still not developed it.

5bf1f4e8-2185-4877-9f27-a901e7086e6a-0
00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:08.520
It's a work in progress.

6a5e889c-4a8d-49a5-b5c7-91e716c72aad-0
00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:12.120
You know, I think somebody mentioned,
you know, real time decimeters.

80bfa3b2-823a-44b7-bdf8-1e9f9843a2f4-0
00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:14.040
You know, we were looking at that.

30f08709-7ca4-415d-90b6-7ce9fea83e06-0
00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:17.700
We were for some time realizing the dose
aware system and you know,

30f08709-7ca4-415d-90b6-7ce9fea83e06-1
00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:19.800
something that you see real time on it.

57c5494f-19fe-4934-b7bc-50f525c91833-0
00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:22.255
I mean,
you see people like running behind the

57c5494f-19fe-4934-b7bc-50f525c91833-1
00:37:22.255 --> 00:37:24.680
shield,
walking away and just basic thing like,

57c5494f-19fe-4934-b7bc-50f525c91833-2
00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:26.954
you know,
distance from the eye eye when you

57c5494f-19fe-4934-b7bc-50f525c91833-3
00:37:26.954 --> 00:37:30.239
actually see, you know,
you see your level and you see everybody

57c5494f-19fe-4934-b7bc-50f525c91833-4
00:37:30.239 --> 00:37:33.120
else's level in the room,
that's immediately actionable.

9780bf10-a3ad-44d1-a75e-70e8d40d74e4-0
00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:35.880
But that's something that I think can
actually change behavior.

d366b127-d3fe-455a-b2b5-8356c1ed7c07-0
00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:40.483
You can also have a wall of shame of
people who have the highest radiation

d366b127-d3fe-455a-b2b5-8356c1ed7c07-1
00:37:40.483 --> 00:37:42.720
closure every month and for those who
only report monthly.

ec7f0c8b-5890-4f62-b644-1a8089fe93c0-0
00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:45.880
True, true.

101b085c-5db5-4f6e-b2a8-0e165994fd63-0
00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:46.320
Bella.

a587f855-f141-48fa-b2f2-934c769d0000-0
00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:49.800
I think that Bella Housing,
our Co director is now with us now.

e9ea9697-fa89-46c4-9534-76c6c2d18a03-0
00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:53.360
I think you had a question there for a
second.

da1bb0b8-3b56-4885-b9ec-13ea5ea0a44c-0
00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:57.880
Yeah, it was just to say sorry,
I've got IT issues going on.

5804ea82-ec79-4240-9876-4caa4a503cc7-0
00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:05.240
It was just to add on that the monitoring
isn't designed to stop you from working.

eed482b0-642e-4bcd-a4a7-39ae40195747-0
00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:09.440
It's more to edit what tools you have or
improve them.

c8f74cd6-28ad-4a26-aa57-ba32a1380683-0
00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:15.080
So trainees should never see wearing a
badge as a potential to stop you working?

c626d48d-bea1-4d5c-a31f-26a857509e51-0
00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:16.320
Absolutely not.

1e0da7bb-da03-4a26-b971-f4587024bf83-0
00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:22.177
You can continue working for as long as
you want as long as you have the right

1e0da7bb-da03-4a26-b971-f4587024bf83-1
00:38:22.177 --> 00:38:24.240
tools to reduce the scatter.

18d4c8bc-f9fb-46f2-ae33-3d76de8db3a4-0
00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:28.270
So if anything,
it's a motivational tool to make you do

18d4c8bc-f9fb-46f2-ae33-3d76de8db3a4-1
00:38:28.270 --> 00:38:29.360
the right things.

4e87c4c3-023d-44ae-963c-e71d5539ed12-0
00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:34.047
And that's really important because if
trainees go in with the mindset that this

4e87c4c3-023d-44ae-963c-e71d5539ed12-1
00:38:34.047 --> 00:38:37.802
may prevent them working rather than this
will prolong them working,

4e87c4c3-023d-44ae-963c-e71d5539ed12-2
00:38:37.802 --> 00:38:40.360
then their attitude and behavior would
change.

3594bb2b-5ae8-4e51-9153-ee59ecf32706-0
00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:42.640
So it's important to send that message
out.

efd55234-5653-4b95-babc-e03b205e0e2b-0
00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.400
These tools are there to help you,
not stop you from working.

cbc05ed5-af87-485b-ac99-df254e47ceff-0
00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:48.800
It's your actions don't stop you from
working.

d1d4ecd0-5d8d-4509-bf45-1e63d02cd060-0
00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:51.040
So that that that's a really important
point.

4b572be2-1f39-42bb-ad1b-b15a8efba3a6-0
00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:55.280
The second thing with the data is as much
or as little as you want.

3916ab19-4dfa-4fb8-88c2-db98ee32bb95-0
00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:58.950
You can be proactive with it,
with it and obtain as much information as

3916ab19-4dfa-4fb8-88c2-db98ee32bb95-1
00:38:58.950 --> 00:39:01.040
you want, or you could be just as little.

208184ed-1b71-4006-a7c8-0d2f685010d6-0
00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:03.280
Only tell me when I reach my dose.

189d060f-d851-4184-a929-c0ed67d09967-0
00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:07.280
For those that have been super vigilant
from day one.

61c7a873-4fbd-4998-86bc-438f3e1dfa42-0
00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:12.125
I I don't know of any that have ever
reached anywhere close to the limits no

61c7a873-4fbd-4998-86bc-438f3e1dfa42-1
00:39:12.125 --> 00:39:13.800
matter how much they've done.

c4fbd956-5718-4c9f-a954-e163cb6ce1cf-0
00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:18.120
So long as you follow the set protocols
you're almost behind.

78505d7c-a2b8-4cce-835e-9b325b09e069-0
00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:23.560
Mobile lead Shields is very rare for you
to reach the dose limits.

7442fd35-9edb-4f52-bd42-1f39af21f568-0
00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:28.120
So it's just to reassure any of the young
audience listening here not to freak out

7442fd35-9edb-4f52-bd42-1f39af21f568-1
00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:29.000
and to continue.

043f58c8-1981-451f-8b00-d9dabe55afff-0
00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:34.431
The funny thing is if you compare our
work with any other industry or lead

043f58c8-1981-451f-8b00-d9dabe55afff-1
00:39:34.431 --> 00:39:37.406
athletes or any professional sports
people,

043f58c8-1981-451f-8b00-d9dabe55afff-2
00:39:37.406 --> 00:39:40.720
they would never go in without their
monitoring.

4780e01e-2376-449b-af11-59683ab5c10f-0
00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:45.320
They would never compete in competitions
without having some sort of monitoring.

dc9a3af1-8dbd-41d0-a624-6c2393c0b033-0
00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:48.160
And I think we need to be in the same
league and mentality.

49616b82-3087-4410-910b-529b5ccf2fa2-0
00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:53.090
Yeah, I do you know,
you almost think that we need to take

49616b82-3087-4410-910b-529b5ccf2fa2-1
00:39:53.090 --> 00:39:57.920
ownership of our occupation,
that that this is an occupational risk.

13867d55-1b55-40a5-9a4a-6e75dbf55b66-0
00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:02.874
We need to do whatever we possibly can to
lower that risk for, you know,

13867d55-1b55-40a5-9a4a-6e75dbf55b66-1
00:40:02.874 --> 00:40:08.016
for not only ourselves, but but you know,
we owe it to our families and everyone

13867d55-1b55-40a5-9a4a-6e75dbf55b66-2
00:40:08.016 --> 00:40:11.000
else that that that loves us and cares
for us.

50fd5470-493e-4fa9-b26e-87240b10d48c-0
00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:15.215
And so I do think like you say,
I think using all the tools that are

50fd5470-493e-4fa9-b26e-87240b10d48c-1
00:40:15.215 --> 00:40:17.720
available to change that and modify that.

3402ce6c-5af8-46d6-a320-ff84addd1f07-0
00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:20.840
I know that you say that y'all y'all
rarely reach your limit.

f7bcad9f-d475-4a90-9f2f-76a8978e2cd0-0
00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:21.600
So I don't think that's.

d06163f6-7c04-4503-a75c-196a07cf982a-0
00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:25.649
The case here and we and our limits are 2
1/2 times what yours are and we're still

d06163f6-7c04-4503-a75c-196a07cf982a-1
00:40:25.649 --> 00:40:28.758
exceeding them in a lot,
especially in training when you know we

d06163f6-7c04-4503-a75c-196a07cf982a-2
00:40:28.758 --> 00:40:31.340
have fellows,
fellows are in front of us and they're,

d06163f6-7c04-4503-a75c-196a07cf982a-3
00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:33.588
you know,
they're done a lot of cases and they

d06163f6-7c04-4503-a75c-196a07cf982a-4
00:40:33.588 --> 00:40:34.880
don't really understand it.

76653016-154a-4b3e-845d-46e6f4db4d96-0
00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:38.777
When you do better about educating them
and and getting them to the point where

76653016-154a-4b3e-845d-46e6f4db4d96-1
00:40:38.777 --> 00:40:41.066
it's a,
where you know it's safe and in training

76653016-154a-4b3e-845d-46e6f4db4d96-2
00:40:41.066 --> 00:40:41.440
as well.

3072068f-fa94-4ad3-89ae-8fb00f3b929f-0
00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:44.840
Hey, Bob, hey Bob, it's, it's her.

5e24d5a9-956c-4c68-ae19-32632145b0e0-0
00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:46.320
Sorry I fell off there.

6bc6fd7e-7859-4859-a4a9-fa25684d2293-0
00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:48.320
But I was just going to say it's
interesting.

50904830-249c-4279-8292-7b4527914f04-0
00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:53.418
We looked at our fellows over the last
year and they have been leadless behind

50904830-249c-4279-8292-7b4527914f04-1
00:40:53.418 --> 00:40:57.483
barriers and they're,
they're very fastidious about being very

50904830-249c-4279-8292-7b4527914f04-2
00:40:57.483 --> 00:40:58.000
careful.

91919a60-6763-492e-a1b0-c1877954f4b9-0
00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:02.168
And we compared it to Dos symmetry five
years before,

91919a60-6763-492e-a1b0-c1877954f4b9-1
00:41:02.168 --> 00:41:06.160
and it was 110th without the lead
compared to the past.

e920af83-e50a-4f66-a1da-6538ab4b496f-0
00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:10.520
And maybe they, you know,
part of it is they're even more aware.

87168e20-0219-4ee7-83e8-bed9086fbb9c-0
00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:12.800
They have to be careful because they
don't have lead on.

fea0bd0a-9078-411d-a6cb-df89bf4b9dfb-0
00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:14.720
But pretty remarkable.

9c18562d-3a9c-4a96-8ed8-b4b59fd784ea-0
00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:16.960
Hopefully I get published in the near
future.

4eb456e6-360c-4dfd-a8c7-9019c00ed943-0
00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:17.680
Yeah.

62198d3d-ac3c-4bd6-9d0b-926b08616c8b-0
00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:18.440
Would you change?

ac978c15-e6a9-4a7a-af50-ac996d71df9e-0
00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:20.120
I think you've changed the culture.

3cd62088-6f40-4da3-a1a5-07b361e5d0b6-0
00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:21.680
That is something to pay attention to.

8a416726-9255-479b-8067-539cec61d27e-0
00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:24.040
And so how do people do that in their lab?

58731ad9-130b-4944-b7e7-40c140fe28da-0
00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:25.440
Because you're going to have.

2bf0e0f3-24ce-448f-b306-1feac5d74c29-0
00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:30.176
I know at least in my lab, you know,
you've got some resistors or just say,

2bf0e0f3-24ce-448f-b306-1feac5d74c29-1
00:41:30.176 --> 00:41:31.360
yeah, I don't care.

edbea16c-1479-4d8f-8952-e59619e93863-0
00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:32.600
You know, it doesn't really bother me.

c57d45c4-de60-491c-99a5-d48be5e9c68b-0
00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:37.643
And then others that are that really want
to engage this and and and it can be

c57d45c4-de60-491c-99a5-d48be5e9c68b-1
00:41:37.643 --> 00:41:40.333
Chris,
it can be a tech that ruins the whole

c57d45c4-de60-491c-99a5-d48be5e9c68b-2
00:41:40.333 --> 00:41:44.280
thing that you're just like,
I don't want to take the extra time.

c0faeaad-71ca-4f10-be7e-7f08abe8ae2b-0
00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:45.320
And you know, I don't.

0c8572e2-2d95-4f5c-ae27-7debb6689499-0
00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:48.560
And so then the doctor said, yeah, OK,
I'm not going to fight it.

e9117564-5e04-41d8-977f-e3a38297b8c5-0
00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:51.720
And then you end up with a culture where
nobody cares about it.

c5d3939d-656d-4dfc-ba50-09659d8d4ef7-0
00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:53.680
So how do we turn that around?

9f2a7ebe-348e-4837-9d4f-3560cb659918-0
00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:54.800
How do we turn the culture?

50844813-53a4-44cc-94a5-31532193bb47-0
00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:57.910
Well,
that's just part of not only patient care,

50844813-53a4-44cc-94a5-31532193bb47-1
00:41:57.910 --> 00:42:01.908
but part of, you know,
caring for ourselves and and becoming a

50844813-53a4-44cc-94a5-31532193bb47-2
00:42:01.908 --> 00:42:02.480
standard.

ee6e7a2a-ec35-458d-949f-e260bec3b0e2-0
00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:05.298
Bob,
I think you've been on the head in that

ee6e7a2a-ec35-458d-949f-e260bec3b0e2-1
00:42:05.298 --> 00:42:09.314
if you're establishing a culture here of
protecting yourself and your staff and

ee6e7a2a-ec35-458d-949f-e260bec3b0e2-2
00:42:09.314 --> 00:42:11.974
and frankly,
the resistance can come from attack and

ee6e7a2a-ec35-458d-949f-e260bec3b0e2-3
00:42:11.974 --> 00:42:13.280
can come from a physician.

80ba72c2-07c2-4276-a9dc-19c3dd70fb8e-0
00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:17.672
And as Cath lab leaders, you know,
we have some responsibility for setting

80ba72c2-07c2-4276-a9dc-19c3dd70fb8e-1
00:42:17.672 --> 00:42:20.951
the stage and making it both easy to use
and then, you know,

80ba72c2-07c2-4276-a9dc-19c3dd70fb8e-2
00:42:20.951 --> 00:42:23.640
forcing the use so that people become
used to it.

738bfd6c-ab4a-4652-9f1d-f745ff8229aa-0
00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:26.160
How did we become used to wearing lead
all this time?

547f6b30-733d-42db-b917-ad0bbb36d479-0
00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:29.240
Maybe we got a culture where it became
part of the norm.

fcf14aa7-403c-489e-bec4-25f128185bb0-0
00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:30.000
That's what we did.

31a3ca95-a4c2-4ecb-b60b-e2890a33b8f6-0
00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:32.029
You know,
how do we get used to wearing all this

31a3ca95-a4c2-4ecb-b60b-e2890a33b8f6-1
00:42:32.029 --> 00:42:32.720
lead for all day?

d0846688-c0c2-4d32-9b89-eb44fb4f1527-0
00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:33.720
Because that's what we did.

83f4d73a-1036-47d9-a130-9eef910b0586-0
00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:38.040
The the familiarity breeds the comfort
with working with this scattered

83f4d73a-1036-47d9-a130-9eef910b0586-1
00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:38.640
radiation.

6f013125-e86d-4005-9275-d089127634fa-0
00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.360
And I'm dealing with this right now.

65582c42-d5c0-4fb1-87d8-965a00792247-0
00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:42.964
I have a new physician in my lab and I'm
deciding, you know,

65582c42-d5c0-4fb1-87d8-965a00792247-1
00:42:42.964 --> 00:42:46.508
when do I force him into getting him out
of his comfort zone with wearing lead and

65582c42-d5c0-4fb1-87d8-965a00792247-2
00:42:46.508 --> 00:42:47.960
saying, hey, we have Porteco here.

7e24c586-87db-49b4-8ae2-dd9eecf8f8dd-0
00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:49.640
We're using it on my cases.

88d4a0a6-cf88-4f46-8231-bc89cabaf9c8-0
00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:50.960
Your cases take twice as long.

ce498b06-b7d6-4340-8125-51cfcfb8933c-0
00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:51.920
Why don't you use it?

16a87253-2ebb-4b87-8e6b-b5daa50ab816-0
00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:54.521
You know, and I'm,
I'm trying to get him accustomed to that,

16a87253-2ebb-4b87-8e6b-b5daa50ab816-1
00:42:54.521 --> 00:42:57.678
but eventually I'm gonna have to pull the
trigger and say, you know what,

16a87253-2ebb-4b87-8e6b-b5daa50ab816-2
00:42:57.678 --> 00:42:59.640
this is better for you,
better for the staff.

7c980850-1b65-4bc8-85c0-8fe7dec869a5-0
00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:03.575
I'm going to ask you to, you know,
use this first and then abandon it only

7c980850-1b65-4bc8-85c0-8fe7dec869a5-1
00:43:03.575 --> 00:43:04.880
if you tried it more, right?

8f41ddff-041e-492c-9b98-69b6eebe9c79-0
00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:07.480
I can't agree with you more.

64d31e2a-20c7-472b-a8d6-17ee9499cabc-0
00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:09.600
I think it comes down to a change in
culture.

6b94e00a-eabf-47c0-9752-dba3c2105fdf-0
00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:11.960
And the reality is we have to really look
at ourselves.

4d40c1d0-1354-4b3e-8e96-7ec082f975f1-0
00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:15.778
And if we look at the long term
consequences, not just the radiation,

4d40c1d0-1354-4b3e-8e96-7ec082f975f1-1
00:43:15.778 --> 00:43:18.560
but the orthopedic injuries that we all
encounter.

00b261b8-6fe4-41c9-b09d-0154c11a50b1-0
00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:22.054
And I could tell you,
I've been doing this for 15-16 years and

00b261b8-6fe4-41c9-b09d-0154c11a50b1-1
00:43:22.054 --> 00:43:22.760
my back hurts.

1fd8a523-e917-4a4a-8800-32a181167264-0
00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:27.085
And I, you know,
I want to be able to continue to practice

1fd8a523-e917-4a4a-8800-32a181167264-1
00:43:27.085 --> 00:43:27.360
that.

272e78de-641b-4940-ad11-857e404cd8ab-0
00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:30.699
But you know,
so you see there is no it is very,

272e78de-641b-4940-ad11-857e404cd8ab-1
00:43:30.699 --> 00:43:36.219
very clear from the data the wrong long
term orthopedic repercussions of wearing

272e78de-641b-4940-ad11-857e404cd8ab-2
00:43:36.219 --> 00:43:36.560
lead.

53d2d5d1-b907-4fad-bad5-d51b2b239720-0
00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:41.305
And if we want to really like I think it
is really incumbent upon us, you know,

53d2d5d1-b907-4fad-bad5-d51b2b239720-1
00:43:41.305 --> 00:43:45.000
to protect the next generation of
physicians who are being trained.

8316384c-30ca-4e1b-9693-37b91c591598-0
00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.680
I think we really have to take it down to
the level of training.

c04a3740-8d8f-4f55-8545-15f2a6e82d9d-0
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:51.329
And, you know, as these physicians,
you know, get out of training,

c04a3740-8d8f-4f55-8545-15f2a6e82d9d-1
00:43:51.329 --> 00:43:52.920
this becomes this is their norm.

2b4d696b-bd72-4d1d-ac9e-65dbbb962c6f-0
00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:55.753
And, and, and,
and part and parcel of that is I think we

2b4d696b-bd72-4d1d-ac9e-65dbbb962c6f-1
00:43:55.753 --> 00:43:58.040
need to do better education for these
people.

ce134893-19a9-48e8-8867-f8379ea8f11b-0
00:43:58.760 --> 00:43:58.960
Yeah.

8d451e70-a106-4957-8fea-418b72345f96-0
00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.588
Because I don't know,
I don't know there's any universal

8d451e70-a106-4957-8fea-418b72345f96-1
00:44:01.588 --> 00:44:05.040
standards amongst all the different
specialities that are represented here.

f3ba1f8a-a8ea-4ed5-bf6c-88faee27a13f-0
00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:07.040
There is not.

620cd7ff-7ea0-434f-afe1-54c48cff9ac4-0
00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:09.200
Yeah, I don't think so either.

d0fbea71-6dfb-4a9d-b029-ae4ec7a92698-0
00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:12.400
Do you think I know you talked about the
next generation and.

567b47a6-df70-4b16-8044-26b6aa8081f6-0
00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:17.440
And I feel like, you know, our generation,
it's a generation before me.

58e47e2f-3acd-4434-b6f2-4285e847ff25-0
00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:18.840
I mean, they were tough as nails.

08dbddb6-98d1-4c05-8a20-d32e420cdf5f-0
00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:23.303
And then, you know,
I feel like our generation was a little

08dbddb6-98d1-4c05-8a20-d32e420cdf5f-1
00:44:23.303 --> 00:44:27.378
bit, you know, more that, you know,
this can't hurt me and you know,

08dbddb6-98d1-4c05-8a20-d32e420cdf5f-2
00:44:27.378 --> 00:44:28.560
bulletproof as well.

83854a55-10ea-46df-b143-f069da055d9d-0
00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:34.003
Is this new generation you feel like,
and those of you that are still training

83854a55-10ea-46df-b143-f069da055d9d-1
00:44:34.003 --> 00:44:38.280
fellows and and and residents is,
are they still that mindset?

4c85cabb-3f40-418a-9354-a80e7e896739-0
00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:40.560
Are they more a Wellness?

be39eb43-d5ba-4ddf-a3a7-1cc790f51371-0
00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:43.240
And I'd love to have it on my phone after
every case.

4db1e1a7-5a35-4840-b9fb-0b36ad8ee6aa-0
00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:44.520
How much radiation I got?

f7102a99-7b1b-4836-bd4d-43626fd2d383-0
00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:47.920
Is it going to be easier or harder to get
to this next generation?

28628294-7d93-4346-bc58-5a06b7f1c7bd-0
00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:56.004
I think it'll be easier because they are
more conscious about what they can and

28628294-7d93-4346-bc58-5a06b7f1c7bd-1
00:44:56.004 --> 00:44:56.760
can't say.

1642ac7d-34c7-4d30-b405-2f9583b24af4-0
00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:58.752
I mean,
certainly when I was training you

1642ac7d-34c7-4d30-b405-2f9583b24af4-1
00:44:58.752 --> 00:45:00.080
couldn't complain that much.

67db13e4-3baa-47e5-8f28-1f0f81cf28a4-0
00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:02.720
You know, if you didn't have lead,
you just got on with it.

06438545-44f2-470a-8668-2d1b24472d43-0
00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:05.567
You you wear what you have or don't you
know,

06438545-44f2-470a-8668-2d1b24472d43-1
00:45:05.567 --> 00:45:10.209
there's there's no way around it was I'd
see more trainees and rightly so,

06438545-44f2-470a-8668-2d1b24472d43-2
00:45:10.209 --> 00:45:13.800
ask for appropriate LED because that's
what it should be.

e1353249-eefd-4c46-8325-bd8a8129451c-0
00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:19.240
So the interesting thing is for those
from surgical background,

e1353249-eefd-4c46-8325-bd8a8129451c-1
00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:24.040
I I trained in surgery prior to this,
There's no way you would come out without

e1353249-eefd-4c46-8325-bd8a8129451c-2
00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:28.840
in the exam stations, the Oscar stations,
you have the station where you had to

e1353249-eefd-4c46-8325-bd8a8129451c-3
00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:30.160
show how you scrubbed.

1ba5b2d7-e43c-4747-ab21-2bbd45a76b61-0
00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:33.280
It's a basic,
but you will not get your Mrs.

904c2ca0-6c5d-4cfa-a288-a3d47c19e0cc-0
00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:34.920
yes, without having done that.

22536cba-c224-4ab3-9f25-111e23953c64-0
00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:39.436
So I think you're forced into learning
even if you're that stupid and never

22536cba-c224-4ab3-9f25-111e23953c64-1
00:45:39.436 --> 00:45:40.520
scrubbed your hands.

53e29a0a-b127-4627-99d6-b1abd323d07c-0
00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:42.200
But that's almost impossible.

0d06b36a-2415-487a-a5f3-cfc7f9b035b9-0
00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:43.760
It should come into our culture.

3eb3c9ca-0e69-48bb-a11d-2eaaa2d6fe63-0
00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:47.440
Whoever works with ionizer radiation,
that that is the norm.

8b25a956-911d-400d-adbd-176eb4f9077e-0
00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:49.440
How do you prevent scatter?

26e24e8d-f18e-45e8-8be1-631b25697532-0
00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:51.960
Is part of should be part of exit exams.

87b98c72-6b42-4a66-b00b-8f281fe2ce23-0
00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:55.080
It should be just normal, like nothing.

51c8dded-1ffa-4573-b5cc-4fb77037619c-0
00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:56.640
Oh, it's an extra.

65127ffa-1c42-485e-bb6a-fda600b81db6-0
00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:57.400
It's not an extra.

b588c707-a086-4c78-a6fe-4010118ba2f8-0
00:45:57.400 --> 00:45:59.200
It's part of the skill that you do.

92b28675-6343-4a44-a7d9-9fcb139cafce-0
00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:02.816
Just like you have to have your hands
clean not to infect the patient or

92b28675-6343-4a44-a7d9-9fcb139cafce-1
00:46:02.816 --> 00:46:05.045
yourself,
injure yourself with needle stick,

92b28675-6343-4a44-a7d9-9fcb139cafce-2
00:46:05.045 --> 00:46:06.680
The same with ionizing radiation.

f878257a-d722-4105-8798-ea144c1e0542-0
00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:10.920
That's I think what I'd like to see basic
stuff implemented in that way.

131d2c6b-19b7-4bc5-9d9e-8d49157ffd6c-0
00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:14.200
Right, Chris,
I think you had your hand up next.

1a5823eb-d054-4a45-ac1a-e844ab49cdd6-0
00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:19.195
Yeah, just from, again,
Cath lab technologist perspective,

1a5823eb-d054-4a45-ac1a-e844ab49cdd6-1
00:46:19.195 --> 00:46:24.760
radiologic technologist perspective,
we're there to optimize your performance.

865574de-88f1-4194-9490-90a2e580f95c-0
00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:26.360
That's our sole job.

ad2971fe-16f9-4d81-a44c-fbaf5a20832d-0
00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:31.809
And we by not taking the lead and being
proactive and radiation safety,

ad2971fe-16f9-4d81-a44c-fbaf5a20832d-1
00:46:31.809 --> 00:46:34.080
we're not allowing you to do that.

2a6401c5-1d2c-4271-a82f-21890b538fee-0
00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:39.600
But we should be the experts in the room,
the, the, the, the technologist.

73191475-243a-4c33-b82c-2ea69572310c-0
00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:46.044
You guys have better things to do during
a case then worry about all the variables

73191475-243a-4c33-b82c-2ea69572310c-1
00:46:46.044 --> 00:46:47.200
involved in that.

bd77f5aa-8757-418a-ab98-83baa89cca14-0
00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:50.572
I, I, and,
and it really makes me happy that

bd77f5aa-8757-418a-ab98-83baa89cca14-1
00:46:50.572 --> 00:46:52.840
everyone's aware of these things.

93682078-cdc1-4eda-ab6b-d0297a54b1d0-0
00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:57.000
But the reason we can't do that is we
don't have the education.

873507cb-0d9e-4476-af2e-46e74ff2bdda-0
00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:01.217
You know, who,
who is standing next to you doing a case

873507cb-0d9e-4476-af2e-46e74ff2bdda-1
00:47:01.217 --> 00:47:02.160
in the cat club.

02fe89c2-515b-44f2-aee2-d1366e349912-0
00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:04.860
And very often they don't have the
training,

02fe89c2-515b-44f2-aee2-d1366e349912-1
00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:07.800
whether they're radiologic technologists
or not.

4e309647-9d3d-455a-bade-878301d206ef-0
00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:11.390
So I,
I think that's a big problem in the

4e309647-9d3d-455a-bade-878301d206ef-1
00:47:11.390 --> 00:47:11.800
culture.

c360a887-bcc7-4d75-afa7-eb6f87640d8c-0
00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:19.195
But I think that empowering them,
providing education and then giving them

c360a887-bcc7-4d75-afa7-eb6f87640d8c-1
00:47:19.195 --> 00:47:24.520
some ownership should be something part
of every lab.

c23bfec1-7ee0-456b-b10b-5cab21d4deeb-0
00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:27.463
Because as I've said,
you can be mindful of it,

c23bfec1-7ee0-456b-b10b-5cab21d4deeb-1
00:47:27.463 --> 00:47:30.406
but you're treating a patient, you know,
we're,

c23bfec1-7ee0-456b-b10b-5cab21d4deeb-2
00:47:30.406 --> 00:47:33.840
we're prepping balloons and moving sea
arms and things.

7b0bdf29-0ed5-4c63-9c54-3e43aa3c3c52-0
00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:38.720
You shouldn't have to worry about us,
and unfortunately, you do.

ad81e16d-a27b-428b-8366-1094628ade6f-0
00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:41.889
Well,
we always think that you all know the

ad81e16d-a27b-428b-8366-1094628ade6f-1
00:47:41.889 --> 00:47:44.137
most because, I mean,
we certainly didn't get much training at

ad81e16d-a27b-428b-8366-1094628ade6f-2
00:47:44.137 --> 00:47:44.280
all.

ba1ca1c0-bfdc-44b2-ab6e-81edb46f0e02-0
00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:48.640
And I think the poor nurses and, you know,
I think they get almost 0 as well.

4233661b-3214-4e77-82fd-9540af7d5cca-0
00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:52.400
So Doctor Sita, yeah, just quick comment.

08a983b3-35a8-41ec-a51d-c5768256c59d-0
00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:54.720
I think every young operator thinks
they're indestructible.

e4424dcf-8535-4a0a-a9d4-a4356a94c2b9-0
00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:55.840
This will never happen to me.

67881808-073a-4360-8d99-da6c21a9fe8e-0
00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:59.665
And the most powerful education you can
offer is those examples of our leaders

67881808-073a-4360-8d99-da6c21a9fe8e-1
00:47:59.665 --> 00:48:03.125
like Doctor Hermel are sharing the
stories of people who are debilitated

67881808-073a-4360-8d99-da6c21a9fe8e-2
00:48:03.125 --> 00:48:03.600
from this.

66242155-0eca-43f1-9a84-71fef0e74f54-0
00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:06.520
And the more we share those stories and
don't run away from them,

66242155-0eca-43f1-9a84-71fef0e74f54-1
00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:09.000
I think that that's the most powerful
education we can offer.

d0486ceb-38d3-484e-a9c5-312314f97a1d-0
00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:09.720
Right.

52429537-e796-45f3-b5b1-5993e5da5fb9-0
00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:11.400
Doctor Miller?

9a2612f2-8c5d-4081-902d-f04332ea2aec-0
00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:16.101
Yeah, I think, Bob,
to your question about the new fellows

9a2612f2-8c5d-4081-902d-f04332ea2aec-1
00:48:16.101 --> 00:48:19.560
and the trainees,
they are very aware of this.

f37e1529-ed20-48e6-b30c-a013bc0ea6ac-0
00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:25.480
I think they they understand also that
there's a chance to get out of the lead.

cbe0d02c-da33-42de-9a2c-d9963ccca97d-0
00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:29.840
I, you know, in our lab,
40% of us have had spinal surgery, right?

aaaac424-fe99-4dca-82e6-5cd03833f001-0
00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:30.720
They see that.

c06706d9-7393-4e33-8621-2b07b05491e7-0
00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:36.425
They know that they're most likely going
to be out of the lab and debilitated due

c06706d9-7393-4e33-8621-2b07b05491e7-1
00:48:36.425 --> 00:48:38.080
to the orthopedic issues.

fa09426e-1b13-4a84-bd0a-5cb5d74c49ec-0
00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:41.070
You know,
God forbid it's a radiation issue,

fa09426e-1b13-4a84-bd0a-5cb5d74c49ec-1
00:48:41.070 --> 00:48:43.920
but it's much more likely to be a spinal
issue.

d3559fcf-714d-4c85-8f2a-e30c2af963d8-0
00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:45.000
And, and they know that.

0f012b04-925f-49fc-8b72-5b2c47143b99-0
00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.423
And now, you know,
when my fellows left last year,

0f012b04-925f-49fc-8b72-5b2c47143b99-1
00:48:47.423 --> 00:48:51.415
they were going to go somewhere that they
had a rampart or an egg nest or a Protago

0f012b04-925f-49fc-8b72-5b2c47143b99-2
00:48:51.415 --> 00:48:54.600
or they weren't going there or they were
going to get promised it.

4cc7a9a7-86f7-40a4-8cd5-1f3be7d0c585-0
00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:58.245
I think they're very aware of it today
and there's,

4cc7a9a7-86f7-40a4-8cd5-1f3be7d0c585-1
00:48:58.245 --> 00:49:00.160
there's many more options available.

2ef7deee-45f7-4139-9cc9-83bcb4a2ef59-0
00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:02.729
So, you know,
I think it's something that we can

2ef7deee-45f7-4139-9cc9-83bcb4a2ef59-1
00:49:02.729 --> 00:49:04.880
definitely train our, our younger people.

80302133-ab77-451d-ba01-1f997a71f0fd-0
00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:07.600
I think I think a bigger issue is going
to be OK.

c522a666-514b-4b07-9a22-b32a5220bbfc-0
00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:11.023
Like you, like you just stated, you know,
these are people who want to go to labs

c522a666-514b-4b07-9a22-b32a5220bbfc-1
00:49:11.023 --> 00:49:12.400
that have these protection systems.

af981286-04f2-4ce0-bcba-610b7a84ab31-0
00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:14.840
But let's say you're at a lab that
doesn't have it.

b3a5215c-6dcb-4aba-a9cd-aff5b5d55a19-0
00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:18.263
How do you get your employer or how do
you get the hospital system to actually

b3a5215c-6dcb-4aba-a9cd-aff5b5d55a19-1
00:49:18.263 --> 00:49:19.000
get one of these?

eea8c342-fb36-453e-b62d-c4faccddbf56-0
00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:20.880
It can be a little bit more challenging.

e735b11a-4282-4597-9e9e-8b3614b27696-0
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:22.815
I mean,
it obviously depends on the hospital

e735b11a-4282-4597-9e9e-8b3614b27696-1
00:49:22.815 --> 00:49:24.752
system,
but it can be a little more challenging

e735b11a-4282-4597-9e9e-8b3614b27696-2
00:49:24.752 --> 00:49:25.600
than you might think.

de9caa90-9a04-4f91-ab59-cf0063fde64e-0
00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:28.889
Yeah,
I think that the the time that you have

de9caa90-9a04-4f91-ab59-cf0063fde64e-1
00:49:28.889 --> 00:49:31.876
the most powers,
like when you're coming out of fellowship,

de9caa90-9a04-4f91-ab59-cf0063fde64e-2
00:49:31.876 --> 00:49:35.759
I'll come if or if you're a more senior
person that that maybe can, you know,

de9caa90-9a04-4f91-ab59-cf0063fde64e-3
00:49:35.759 --> 00:49:38.547
wield a little bit a little bit of weight
or, you know,

de9caa90-9a04-4f91-ab59-cf0063fde64e-4
00:49:38.547 --> 00:49:40.239
unfortunately you've been injured.

e74da292-924e-4a39-9cbd-5570db4c4ec1-0
00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:42.720
You know, like me and others where,
you know,

e74da292-924e-4a39-9cbd-5570db4c4ec1-1
00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:44.880
they don't want to they don't want to
lose, you know,

e74da292-924e-4a39-9cbd-5570db4c4ec1-2
00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:46.400
one of their highest volume operators.

152171c1-0640-4b3c-bbf5-deb2a5efa174-0
00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:47.840
And so they're kind of forced into it.

db096c20-e9ae-4044-994c-658a1306a90f-0
00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:50.360
But it, you know, like you say,
it shouldn't be that way.

d5b60b13-ca21-4ea2-b419-604d5416c55f-0
00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:55.712
Ragu and apologize for calling you by
your first name, but I'm going to butcher,

d5b60b13-ca21-4ea2-b419-604d5416c55f-1
00:49:55.712 --> 00:49:56.520
no disrespect.

03cb31a2-a8ec-4034-bd92-bab6b5cb8510-0
00:49:56.760 --> 00:49:57.720
That's the best way.

1650187a-c734-43b5-b9fc-bd195a1ed1f3-0
00:49:57.720 --> 00:49:58.360
That's the best way.

dc637c5e-1b8d-4704-b86a-054b889f6aba-0
00:49:58.360 --> 00:49:58.760
Thank you.

0e991a98-fc9b-4d49-aa63-011d4463c762-0
00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:04.049
I was just thinking that, you know,
unfortunately, like Ripple said,

0e991a98-fc9b-4d49-aa63-011d4463c762-1
00:50:04.049 --> 00:50:09.393
he's been doing it for 15 odd years and
then the back starts painting anything,

0e991a98-fc9b-4d49-aa63-011d4463c762-2
00:50:09.393 --> 00:50:12.600
be it cataract,
be it musculoskeletal problems.

de7944b7-200f-475d-92ab-6386d5f27542-0
00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:14.560
Unfortunately it doesn't happen on day
one.

5df244ef-e711-4178-b228-74b00f89d446-0
00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:19.464
It takes a long term and that's when I
come back to I support what Chris is

5df244ef-e711-4178-b228-74b00f89d446-1
00:50:19.464 --> 00:50:24.367
saying is I think education is the key to
to kind of highlight the fact that this

5df244ef-e711-4178-b228-74b00f89d446-2
00:50:24.367 --> 00:50:26.520
is something that's going to happen.

846e40ea-ad90-4aea-bb6b-524c61724f66-0
00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:30.878
And then if you're a new operator, you,
you the stress of performing the

846e40ea-ad90-4aea-bb6b-524c61724f66-1
00:50:30.878 --> 00:50:33.812
procedure,
the stress of getting it right to prove

846e40ea-ad90-4aea-bb6b-524c61724f66-2
00:50:33.812 --> 00:50:35.480
that you're doing everything.

a0d2a029-6259-4262-979c-fab852f6e35c-0
00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:40.024
Then what happens is radiation gets to
the background and then it's not at the

a0d2a029-6259-4262-979c-fab852f6e35c-1
00:50:40.024 --> 00:50:40.600
forefront.

27cde28d-7fb5-41ff-90d3-eecc670822f4-0
00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:43.940
And that's why we were talking about the,
the,

27cde28d-7fb5-41ff-90d3-eecc670822f4-1
00:50:43.940 --> 00:50:48.360
the person who's pressing the panel
actually gets more importance.

5517bbc1-98fa-40a0-b0c3-3a364a4e6f88-0
00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:55.080
And I am really pleased with your
suggestion, Bob, of radiation time out.

9327a0b5-f45a-460d-bb05-5a8aef0994bf-0
00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:59.359
And I'm thinking that when I go back to
our, our unit in the NHS, we're, we're,

9327a0b5-f45a-460d-bb05-5a8aef0994bf-1
00:50:59.359 --> 00:51:01.981
we're going to try and do it at least,
you know,

9327a0b5-f45a-460d-bb05-5a8aef0994bf-2
00:51:01.981 --> 00:51:06.314
once a day in the morning before you get
started through the day so that it kind

9327a0b5-f45a-460d-bb05-5a8aef0994bf-3
00:51:06.314 --> 00:51:08.080
of clicks through people's minds.

63400914-1153-4f82-b41a-018fd946ad82-0
00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:13.543
Yeah, we, we in,
in the National Health Service, it's,

63400914-1153-4f82-b41a-018fd946ad82-1
00:51:13.543 --> 00:51:19.419
it's far more difficult for economic
reasons to try and get some of those egg

63400914-1153-4f82-b41a-018fd946ad82-2
00:51:19.419 --> 00:51:22.960
nest protection or whatever you're
looking at.

4de3648c-fb84-47f5-abdb-04fba6127614-0
00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:28.014
But I think there are simple things that
you can do right at the beginning,

4de3648c-fb84-47f5-abdb-04fba6127614-1
00:51:28.014 --> 00:51:30.840
which will have long lasting effects and
outcome.

905000d0-7354-4355-a4f4-6e39c0df8d62-0
00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:32.680
Thank you, Doctor Mugg.

dbacf8b1-ed29-4d35-ae3e-b6459a91e3f0-0
00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:33.880
Yeah.

16d77b9d-872e-4a93-90b8-9af2084613ef-0
00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:37.720
You know, first your question, Bob,
about the younger generation.

cfb9fa7c-ae14-49e1-88a3-8f745a4cdd1e-0
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:41.240
I agree with the others without a doubt
that they already know what's going on.

6561ffb9-7483-4125-b87f-d3ddf3e6b89b-0
00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:46.160
They're on Twitter, Instagram, etcetera,
and they absolutely are looking at this.

dde04895-6505-4050-8069-bf10a172e122-0
00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:49.894
I've had Med students come up to us at
the national meeting and say, Hey,

dde04895-6505-4050-8069-bf10a172e122-1
00:51:49.894 --> 00:51:52.720
I saw what you're doing, you know,
leadless angiograms.

f914dba1-2262-4a42-8917-ee4344a97d08-0
00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:53.520
That's unheard of.

d562a5dc-078d-4d26-a8d4-220c45dfca4f-0
00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:57.240
So I think that without a doubt that,
that, that they're going to embrace it.

1b3d79dd-fdf5-4f37-8a09-8018f2041c05-0
00:51:57.480 --> 00:52:01.120
The days of getting yelled at for seven
straight years like I did,

1b3d79dd-fdf5-4f37-8a09-8018f2041c05-1
00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:04.651
those days are over, you know, but,
but my question is you, you,

1b3d79dd-fdf5-4f37-8a09-8018f2041c05-2
00:52:04.651 --> 00:52:09.160
you kind of introduced us all as experts
and clearly I'm not, I'm, I'm a champion,

1b3d79dd-fdf5-4f37-8a09-8018f2041c05-3
00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:12.040
but you all are the experts and have the
experience.

ab12bc4d-c278-4c12-9444-9529418fe887-0
00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:18.729
At what point can I,
what data points do I need when I have

ab12bc4d-c278-4c12-9444-9529418fe887-1
00:52:18.729 --> 00:52:24.200
already techs and, and,
and our surgery residents who are doing

ab12bc4d-c278-4c12-9444-9529418fe887-2
00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:26.680
evars wanting to go leadless?

f6bf9d97-9b23-4402-935c-f78b916f968f-0
00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:29.920
And I, and I told him I'm like,
I think we need our own data.

be3a3986-d1c6-406e-94e8-bfb1b48e595f-0
00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:33.017
I'm not familiar if there's any data out
there, You know,

be3a3986-d1c6-406e-94e8-bfb1b48e595f-1
00:52:33.017 --> 00:52:36.557
when we're going transfemoral and,
and obviously we got different obliques

be3a3986-d1c6-406e-94e8-bfb1b48e595f-2
00:52:36.557 --> 00:52:37.360
for it for evars.

45a4aafe-ef33-45dc-a6a2-5dd37e93b617-0
00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:40.120
Is there data out there?

a3cb059d-18f6-4811-9792-90da2e4406cb-0
00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:43.474
And if not,
what do we need to generate so that I can

a3cb059d-18f6-4811-9792-90da2e4406cb-1
00:52:43.474 --> 00:52:48.320
be responsible and look at them and say,
Hey, Emily and Cody, it's it's cool.

128509fd-da58-46fc-aac6-7d282de03136-0
00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:52.201
Go ahead and go without your lead on this
EVAR because they're ready to do it

128509fd-da58-46fc-aac6-7d282de03136-1
00:52:52.201 --> 00:52:52.600
already.

9e83ccf6-77af-43e3-8088-aa1a9a681003-0
00:52:52.600 --> 00:52:53.400
And we have a tech.

40cfde3b-7371-4b2f-8808-74f1d7c46b4d-0
00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:56.068
We did a fever the other day, took,
you know,

40cfde3b-7371-4b2f-8808-74f1d7c46b4d-1
00:52:56.068 --> 00:52:58.760
a couple hours and Joey took his lead off
already.

2d145ccf-6637-4118-8552-998af1c6531a-0
00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:01.200
But I was like, I, I think, am I wrong?

f158bbee-7e15-4fa4-a07e-31e8ba3bb70d-0
00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:02.400
Do we need more data?

0d3d79ce-19a2-4e60-8b91-6d51419ef88d-0
00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:06.746
And if so,
what's your all's expert recommendations

0d3d79ce-19a2-4e60-8b91-6d51419ef88d-1
00:53:06.746 --> 00:53:13.600
as to to what I need to look at them and
safely say it's OK to shed the lead live

0d3d79ce-19a2-4e60-8b91-6d51419ef88d-2
00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:14.520
monitoring?

51e26b7c-ac6c-4020-9f45-c9090a61e296-0
00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:15.120
Go ahead.

d45c4f9c-8c01-4729-93be-8431cbf6cac2-0
00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:17.680
Sorry I just interrupted.

00f45b9e-635c-458b-abdd-e002acdca946-0
00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:21.873
It was just because we went through
something similar and one of the

00f45b9e-635c-458b-abdd-e002acdca946-1
00:53:21.873 --> 00:53:24.000
approvals required live monitoring.

e7e16cd3-4602-4eb7-a232-9c625e721906-0
00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:27.964
So you're dosing me tell his life,
you know,

e7e16cd3-4602-4eb7-a232-9c625e721906-1
00:53:27.964 --> 00:53:29.720
it shows that nothing's happening.

7fa127de-c5f0-49ea-8909-99fd5d7327fe-0
00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:33.246
So is there a certain threshold,
so to speak,

7fa127de-c5f0-49ea-8909-99fd5d7327fe-1
00:53:33.246 --> 00:53:35.600
that you that you you all recommend?

3bb00b0c-8fd9-49a7-b564-492f4b6e8e8b-0
00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:37.240
Because we just we got that.

e7021dd9-8702-4e5e-bc52-7f847192879b-0
00:53:37.240 --> 00:53:39.320
Bob's been nice enough to help us with
that.

5ba4eb97-fdf7-42af-aa8a-52e45f32f7b9-0
00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:43.360
And literally we're just in our infancy
in the last four weeks we started this.

1934210b-9219-438e-aded-20fe30a93ba6-0
00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:47.125
Is there a certain number I can look at
and say, hey,

1934210b-9219-438e-aded-20fe30a93ba6-1
00:53:47.125 --> 00:53:52.010
I think we're OK to shed the lead,
or is that still unknown for abdominal

1934210b-9219-438e-aded-20fe30a93ba6-2
00:53:52.010 --> 00:53:55.840
visceral type work,
which I'm assuming that's the answer.

0937eda4-50a3-4fa6-a067-b8921e584cbf-0
00:53:58.960 --> 00:53:59.240
Yeah.

947b4d74-9fe9-4611-aaa5-b63e9f72ddd6-0
00:53:59.240 --> 00:54:03.189
I mean, you know,
I can kind of weigh in on just at least

947b4d74-9fe9-4611-aaa5-b63e9f72ddd6-1
00:54:03.189 --> 00:54:04.960
to start the conversation.

a49b09ce-358b-4b21-9562-1217ddcea2e9-0
00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:10.992
But I do think as we get into these newer
procedures with these more advanced

a49b09ce-358b-4b21-9562-1217ddcea2e9-1
00:54:10.992 --> 00:54:15.240
technologies #1 the more dated that you
have, the better.

f4e1b362-f393-4f14-8299-eb26e7fb63bc-0
00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:19.094
And so if you can have, you know,
obviously you know,

f4e1b362-f393-4f14-8299-eb26e7fb63bc-1
00:54:19.094 --> 00:54:23.020
some of the highest level of, of data,
like, you know,

f4e1b362-f393-4f14-8299-eb26e7fb63bc-2
00:54:23.020 --> 00:54:27.160
randomized trials or large series or
something like that,

f4e1b362-f393-4f14-8299-eb26e7fb63bc-3
00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:32.157
that you can show that data and show it
that at your facility you're,

f4e1b362-f393-4f14-8299-eb26e7fb63bc-4
00:54:32.157 --> 00:54:36.083
you're reaching that,
then then I think you, you know,

f4e1b362-f393-4f14-8299-eb26e7fb63bc-5
00:54:36.083 --> 00:54:41.865
in my mind that if you can say that that
clearly what I'm getting is better than

f4e1b362-f393-4f14-8299-eb26e7fb63bc-6
00:54:41.865 --> 00:54:46.720
what I was getting, then then you know,
you're showing improvement.

b3064184-349b-4dcb-81a9-9bb16100335b-0
00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:50.493
If it's showing improvement over what you
were getting at a baseline,

b3064184-349b-4dcb-81a9-9bb16100335b-1
00:54:50.493 --> 00:54:53.998
then you should be able,
you should to technically be able to do

b3064184-349b-4dcb-81a9-9bb16100335b-2
00:54:53.998 --> 00:54:54.159
it.

6cc46af5-c4a4-4966-9fb2-61084a922cc1-0
00:54:54.160 --> 00:54:58.329
Now every state's different and you have
to bring in the radiation safety officers

6cc46af5-c4a4-4966-9fb2-61084a922cc1-1
00:54:58.329 --> 00:55:00.640
and,
and right now you have to get clearance.

87b8d49f-b959-4690-bae7-2d258da8edb6-0
00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:05.320
I know that sky is working really hard
even to begin maybe at the state level to

87b8d49f-b959-4690-bae7-2d258da8edb6-1
00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:09.942
make some changes where if you have the
data, if you're doing those procedures,

87b8d49f-b959-4690-bae7-2d258da8edb6-2
00:55:09.942 --> 00:55:13.813
if you have real time monitoring,
if you're reaching these levels,

87b8d49f-b959-4690-bae7-2d258da8edb6-3
00:55:13.813 --> 00:55:15.200
then then you can do it.

52817361-1c6f-4bf5-89b2-b0047506ac11-0
00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:18.120
But I think right now it's,
it's a little bit arbitrary.

731e20ad-7d5d-4b7e-8347-19c99dbeb73d-0
00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:21.724
You need to talk about what is the
threshold And, and I think it, you know,

731e20ad-7d5d-4b7e-8347-19c99dbeb73d-1
00:55:21.724 --> 00:55:24.237
it's very,
it's very hard to say what that threshold

731e20ad-7d5d-4b7e-8347-19c99dbeb73d-2
00:55:24.237 --> 00:55:26.040
is because you don't know what it was.

0d4d2201-7663-452d-a859-cea58f33f5fc-0
00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:29.281
And people aren't, you know,
we can tell you what the,

0d4d2201-7663-452d-a859-cea58f33f5fc-1
00:55:29.281 --> 00:55:33.372
in a lot of these studies, what the,
how much radiation they were typically

0d4d2201-7663-452d-a859-cea58f33f5fc-2
00:55:33.372 --> 00:55:34.880
getting for certain studies.

c8fea595-9c4d-45ac-aeb5-2cfb205e3d09-0
00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:38.107
And, and if,
if a certain technology can markedly

c8fea595-9c4d-45ac-aeb5-2cfb205e3d09-1
00:55:38.107 --> 00:55:41.657
improve on that,
then that should be an alternative to

c8fea595-9c4d-45ac-aeb5-2cfb205e3d09-2
00:55:41.657 --> 00:55:43.400
what you were doing before.

d846f359-a8f7-4696-88ca-eccdb51433d9-0
00:55:43.720 --> 00:55:48.507
But but again, it's got to be, you know,
we need some consensus among among all of

d846f359-a8f7-4696-88ca-eccdb51433d9-1
00:55:48.507 --> 00:55:51.968
us to say, you know,
there there's a number or it's hard to

d846f359-a8f7-4696-88ca-eccdb51433d9-2
00:55:51.968 --> 00:55:54.968
pick a number because you don't know what
you know,

d846f359-a8f7-4696-88ca-eccdb51433d9-3
00:55:54.968 --> 00:55:59.640
what type of procedure you're doing or
where you're standing or whatever because

d846f359-a8f7-4696-88ca-eccdb51433d9-4
00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:02.640
it's going to be different for,
for a lot of those.

25e8fa27-3520-43ca-ad9b-158467f194df-0
00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:08.280
So love to hear the panel on on how to
lower the standard location to somebody.

965a1ac0-7332-4a72-8fc4-e88d047fbcde-0
00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:13.281
Yeah, I was going to say Bob, I,
I think there's really robust data for

965a1ac0-7332-4a72-8fc4-e88d047fbcde-1
00:56:13.281 --> 00:56:17.660
interventional cardiology, right, radial,
femoral and and really for femoral,

965a1ac0-7332-4a72-8fc4-e88d047fbcde-2
00:56:17.660 --> 00:56:20.242
although you know,
our beams up in the chest,

965a1ac0-7332-4a72-8fc4-e88d047fbcde-3
00:56:20.242 --> 00:56:22.600
it's not down in the abdomen for an E bar.

158bfdbb-2afe-40a4-85f6-f435bc6bd63c-0
00:56:22.600 --> 00:56:26.520
And you know,
the Emory group was structural disease.

aabc5cbc-d877-4cb4-9211-87fb3dc57f07-0
00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:27.680
That's all femoral stuff.

b3d7ec3f-60f0-47a9-aaf7-8e3b55d76246-0
00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:30.844
And and you know,
you got a tended 100 fold reduction in

b3d7ec3f-60f0-47a9-aaf7-8e3b55d76246-1
00:56:30.844 --> 00:56:31.400
radiation.

3962c035-2ce5-43a6-a8b2-921f8f3b79b4-0
00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:36.113
We do need data though,
specifically for peripheral vascular and

3962c035-2ce5-43a6-a8b2-921f8f3b79b4-1
00:56:36.113 --> 00:56:37.600
vascular intervention.

3872f345-1200-49fc-be25-64e04900083d-0
00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:39.611
I,
I think that's a really important certain

3872f345-1200-49fc-be25-64e04900083d-1
00:56:39.611 --> 00:56:39.880
point.

6eb293f5-c6d4-46e7-a4c6-f01e654b6eb3-0
00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:41.600
We lack that data.

de208525-ba29-495a-bc1d-79f3e3473c4a-0
00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:43.320
So that could be generated.

65dcf900-8a31-4882-9883-e3f49020f1a1-0
00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:46.480
That would be I think fantastic.

650a151d-c6cc-419f-9095-7aaecef378ed-0
00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:50.720
Yeah,
I think it's important as we go into the

650a151d-c6cc-419f-9095-7aaecef378ed-1
00:56:50.720 --> 00:56:54.868
sub specialties that you have specific
sub specialty data as we, you know,

650a151d-c6cc-419f-9095-7aaecef378ed-2
00:56:54.868 --> 00:56:55.920
as we move forward.

7188a77c-e969-4623-9650-2ce0143925d2-0
00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:59.396
And it's kind of impending on the
companies to be able to to do that

7188a77c-e969-4623-9650-2ce0143925d2-1
00:56:59.396 --> 00:57:02.519
because, you know,
you don't want to just take people's word,

7188a77c-e969-4623-9650-2ce0143925d2-2
00:57:02.519 --> 00:57:04.837
you know, word for it that Oh yeah,
you know,

7188a77c-e969-4623-9650-2ce0143925d2-3
00:57:04.837 --> 00:57:08.565
you're probably fine with what you're
doing, but but you don't, you know,

7188a77c-e969-4623-9650-2ce0143925d2-4
00:57:08.565 --> 00:57:11.840
without knowing that I think you could
put people in harm's way.

23ea89a9-9dfd-45fa-8e54-b5be19041447-0
00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:16.240
Yep.

8af23b9e-fb78-4fda-8549-b67fc189106b-0
00:57:17.080 --> 00:57:18.000
Arnold, do you want to?

946857df-a204-4c28-9f16-482b7f9f6fca-0
00:57:18.120 --> 00:57:18.880
I was just going to say this.

f7564242-c3a3-4069-ac28-786290cabf2c-0
00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:22.144
Arnold,
you want to say anything about how do you

f7564242-c3a3-4069-ac28-786290cabf2c-1
00:57:22.144 --> 00:57:25.240
get the hospital to step up and pay for
things?

701c93b8-a030-4ed5-a08c-1f1bc283afa8-0
00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:28.310
Yeah,
I think that's the challenge that we all

701c93b8-a030-4ed5-a08c-1f1bc283afa8-1
00:57:28.310 --> 00:57:28.560
face.

54f0e52a-83f1-466b-b9aa-41c65b5d797b-0
00:57:28.560 --> 00:57:30.603
I mean,
I'm working at some other hospitals,

54f0e52a-83f1-466b-b9aa-41c65b5d797b-1
00:57:30.603 --> 00:57:31.920
at the VA hospital, you know.

c43fd54b-f6c7-4de2-a1d9-8fb5c90bb4eb-0
00:57:31.960 --> 00:57:33.000
Thank you, Mr.

c9f2f4cb-933b-467c-9a0b-cee82361ad8e-0
00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:33.760
Taxpayers.

d2f1334d-717f-4036-a740-8ed35c338645-0
00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:36.753
You know,
we have a mandatory 10 year life

d2f1334d-717f-4036-a740-8ed35c338645-1
00:57:36.753 --> 00:57:38.960
expectancy on all of our X-ray equipment.

dcb61d64-12fe-4785-bc04-b552eb51dd51-0
00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:42.280
So every 10 years I get a new X-ray
machine at $1.5 million.

d105453e-c4ec-4725-903e-506ed0ff705b-0
00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:45.120
So I have the Philips Allure Clarity and
it's seven years old.

0a4af8a1-971b-433a-a195-3acf11e05e9f-0
00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:47.000
I'm going to upgrade in a few years.

cff47458-d2db-4796-9719-e421ee336973-0
00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:51.192
But then I walk into my Community
Hospital and they pulled out a 23 year

cff47458-d2db-4796-9719-e421ee336973-1
00:57:51.192 --> 00:57:55.561
machine which is putting out all sorts of
radiation and even my University Hospital,

cff47458-d2db-4796-9719-e421ee336973-2
00:57:55.561 --> 00:57:57.720
UC Irvine kept their machine for 15 years.

136f2f3a-dd08-4ffb-8afc-b19e4748516d-0
00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:01.211
And so, you know,
granted these are high cost capital

136f2f3a-dd08-4ffb-8afc-b19e4748516d-1
00:58:01.211 --> 00:58:03.827
equipment,
but the really the basic step of

136f2f3a-dd08-4ffb-8afc-b19e4748516d-2
00:58:03.827 --> 00:58:07.990
radiation reduction came with
improvements in image quality and image

136f2f3a-dd08-4ffb-8afc-b19e4748516d-3
00:58:07.990 --> 00:58:11.320
processing with the latest generation
imaging machines.

13efdf15-edc2-4fbc-a7f4-1afc9fe5c47c-0
00:58:11.320 --> 00:58:15.529
And so, you know,
I think that illustrates the problem that,

13efdf15-edc2-4fbc-a7f4-1afc9fe5c47c-1
00:58:15.529 --> 00:58:18.910
you know,
hospitals and hospital administrations

13efdf15-edc2-4fbc-a7f4-1afc9fe5c47c-2
00:58:18.910 --> 00:58:23.119
just want to do the minimum to pass their
minimum standards.

1bd0796a-846b-4160-ac39-90f9d12626cf-0
00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:26.133
And, you know,
we are not empowered to change that

1bd0796a-846b-4160-ac39-90f9d12626cf-1
00:58:26.133 --> 00:58:29.354
minimum standard,
but we can change it with our voices,

1bd0796a-846b-4160-ac39-90f9d12626cf-2
00:58:29.354 --> 00:58:31.080
with, you know, with our feet.

d1e7904a-3ca8-4839-8a22-f37c9eee438d-0
00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:32.952
Your new, your new operators,
like you said, you know,

d1e7904a-3ca8-4839-8a22-f37c9eee438d-1
00:58:32.952 --> 00:58:34.680
when they're when they're coming in,
they want this.

33876dbb-d2a3-4961-86ac-defef8e7bb57-0
00:58:35.080 --> 00:58:39.008
I mean, but but you know, ultimately we,
it takes a collective effort on all of

33876dbb-d2a3-4961-86ac-defef8e7bb57-1
00:58:39.008 --> 00:58:40.040
our parts to do that.

50dded1e-1b39-4182-b8a6-18061b3cc5a4-0
00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:43.104
And hopefully we're, you know,
but we're trying to,

50dded1e-1b39-4182-b8a6-18061b3cc5a4-1
00:58:43.104 --> 00:58:47.193
we're trying to arm all of us with the,
with the so-called toolkit that Bob and,

50dded1e-1b39-4182-b8a6-18061b3cc5a4-2
00:58:47.193 --> 00:58:51.382
and many other societies were working on
together as part of an advocacy coalition

50dded1e-1b39-4182-b8a6-18061b3cc5a4-3
00:58:51.382 --> 00:58:55.017
to we can all share all these,
all this data and all the potential cost

50dded1e-1b39-4182-b8a6-18061b3cc5a4-4
00:58:55.017 --> 00:58:57.439
effectiveness of these,
of these interventions.

f54ec2e7-06d6-484a-90b7-399da9aafea6-0
00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:04.600
We have something called the risk risk
register in the UK.

82c7d595-2e63-425f-bc9c-44296fdf303e-0
00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:08.640
So when we want to replace something,
I can't see the wire.

e9ab06da-46e6-4ac2-98fd-f7bd4ad4268f-0
00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:11.200
And if I can't see the wire,
I can't do the procedure.

58453d75-6a25-4e1f-b405-31a0333c4bee-0
00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:14.880
So that goes high on the risk register
and then you can ask for a new machine.

0eb2d49c-e359-40b3-881c-f5e41f0cae6e-0
00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:17.600
So I don't know if in the US you have
something like that, right?

280cfcc1-d0b2-4e68-b694-36c65e2b1d5a-0
00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:19.640
You don't tell anybody what I'm telling
them.

c587c30f-52c0-4f6a-a26b-b5954a2daf4e-0
00:59:26.760 --> 00:59:32.050
That it's good anyway else I know that
you know, when you looked at the sky,

c587c30f-52c0-4f6a-a26b-b5954a2daf4e-1
00:59:32.050 --> 00:59:36.860
this last sky survey that was done,
it said that the biggest obstacle

c587c30f-52c0-4f6a-a26b-b5954a2daf4e-2
00:59:36.860 --> 00:59:41.532
obviously was cost and and forgetting
some of the some of the newer

c587c30f-52c0-4f6a-a26b-b5954a2daf4e-3
00:59:41.532 --> 00:59:46.960
technologies in it if it's appropriate
for the type of procedures that you do.

38ed5b98-2c90-454e-a7fc-8264912dbbc6-0
00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:49.040
But what kind?

2529eb84-5f1d-445f-9d42-0d42c738618d-0
00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:54.085
I guess one of the one of the things that
I want to bring this panel,

2529eb84-5f1d-445f-9d42-0d42c738618d-1
00:59:54.085 --> 00:59:59.708
it sounds like and talking to to you,
many of you have used all the different

2529eb84-5f1d-445f-9d42-0d42c738618d-2
00:59:59.708 --> 01:00:04.177
time kind of some of these new
technologies, the Rampart Egg,

2529eb84-5f1d-445f-9d42-0d42c738618d-3
01:00:04.177 --> 01:00:09.440
Pertigo G Lift, maybe the new,
the new lead aprons, the BAT radioaction.

e4a31261-e1ec-4dcf-b237-ee7fe0994953-0
01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:15.107
And so if you look at at those devices,
if you have some experience with them,

e4a31261-e1ec-4dcf-b237-ee7fe0994953-1
01:00:15.107 --> 01:00:20.455
what do you see as kind of limitations
for adoption for those right now if you

e4a31261-e1ec-4dcf-b237-ee7fe0994953-2
01:00:20.455 --> 01:00:22.080
take the cost out of it?

eefbb059-5065-4317-9f7f-4d09a931f0ab-0
01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:27.188
What do you see is,
is the kind of limitations for adoption

eefbb059-5065-4317-9f7f-4d09a931f0ab-1
01:00:27.188 --> 01:00:31.617
and what do you see as kind of the
limitations for certain types of

eefbb059-5065-4317-9f7f-4d09a931f0ab-2
01:00:31.617 --> 01:00:35.200
procedures maybe that you have to do some
workarounds.

51b4e84a-57a7-452c-94e1-2a0ee58329c6-0
01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:37.440
I think we talked about this a little bit,
Doctor Seto.

283ee63c-02c4-4065-952a-b880455ebbed-0
01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:39.880
It is what what are those workarounds?

dc8041a2-afa3-4d63-90ed-2f706d73033c-0
01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:43.396
So if our if our audience has one,
has one of these or thinking about

dc8041a2-afa3-4d63-90ed-2f706d73033c-1
01:00:43.396 --> 01:00:46.560
getting one of these,
what are the first thing that you had to

dc8041a2-afa3-4d63-90ed-2f706d73033c-2
01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:50.680
do just a little bit differently that you
learned that made it so that it worked?

f1c69c53-b72b-4292-8636-0cb6fb7c796f-0
01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:52.240
Yeah, I'll just start off.

83e46f4f-5d6e-4dda-950e-ca29b6fc59cd-0
01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:53.320
I have the OR take a machine.

1e8c48c3-cf4b-4ebc-a817-3c15310544d1-0
01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:55.360
We can't do a femoral angiogram with it.

23751ef7-91b6-4dfa-b8ce-4833361c0c53-0
01:00:55.600 --> 01:01:01.680
So we're 95% radial and it encourages us
to go radial for the femoral portion.

8f86acf4-f42c-4cb4-a2cb-16dd159ccbe0-0
01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:06.403
You know we actually use ultrasound for
all of our access and we can actually

8f86acf4-f42c-4cb4-a2cb-16dd159ccbe0-1
01:01:06.403 --> 01:01:10.538
determine the access point by doing a
post insertion ultrasound to just see

8f86acf4-f42c-4cb4-a2cb-16dd159ccbe0-2
01:01:10.538 --> 01:01:13.476
where the wire,
make sure it's above the bifurcation,

8f86acf4-f42c-4cb4-a2cb-16dd159ccbe0-3
01:01:13.476 --> 01:01:16.360
make sure there's no obvious hematoma
forming there.

f4042949-b092-41d1-b4ff-e0c5138d22e1-0
01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:20.714
So I've actually dispensed with the
femoral angiogram in many cases and

f4042949-b092-41d1-b4ff-e0c5138d22e1-1
01:01:20.714 --> 01:01:22.520
hopefully I won't get sued over it.

f8f86a4b-24da-46d7-bb3d-98d60cf278ff-0
01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:28.567
So, Bob,
I would just say in terms of staff sort

f8f86a4b-24da-46d7-bb3d-98d60cf278ff-1
01:01:28.567 --> 01:01:32.979
of resistance to this,
I think once they are out of the lead,

f8f86a4b-24da-46d7-bb3d-98d60cf278ff-2
01:01:32.979 --> 01:01:36.608
there's not,
I mean the value proposition for the,

f8f86a4b-24da-46d7-bb3d-98d60cf278ff-3
01:01:36.608 --> 01:01:41.376
you know, Rampart, Cortego,
that's all of these is you're going to

f8f86a4b-24da-46d7-bb3d-98d60cf278ff-4
01:01:41.376 --> 01:01:42.800
get out of the lead.

1ba15c46-2a68-40b6-bc4d-eb2f27097ad1-0
01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:45.624
Now if you're going to stay in the lead
and still use these,

1ba15c46-2a68-40b6-bc4d-eb2f27097ad1-1
01:01:45.624 --> 01:01:49.050
you're going to get a lot of pushback
because they say, well, what, what,

1ba15c46-2a68-40b6-bc4d-eb2f27097ad1-2
01:01:49.050 --> 01:01:50.439
what am I wasting my time for?

5028a3b0-77ee-4148-aa48-486679ca7c44-0
01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:54.756
Although the time investment and setting
these up is very low,

5028a3b0-77ee-4148-aa48-486679ca7c44-1
01:01:54.756 --> 01:01:57.928
but but I I think without shedding the
lead it's,

5028a3b0-77ee-4148-aa48-486679ca7c44-2
01:01:57.928 --> 01:02:00.720
it's hard to bring it over the finish
line.

ccb00bba-9474-4fc9-9c29-f52bc500daf2-0
01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:09.380
You know, as an intervention radiologist,
we're often doing procedures and,

ccb00bba-9474-4fc9-9c29-f52bc500daf2-1
01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:11.000
you know, various parts of the body.

6409314c-f7e3-4d6d-9e60-cc5a5e7d2050-0
01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:14.005
You know, a lot of these systems,
I haven't really, you know, it,

6409314c-f7e3-4d6d-9e60-cc5a5e7d2050-1
01:02:14.005 --> 01:02:15.280
it doesn't really work well.

12071612-0e62-411c-827f-70a8abeca654-0
01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:19.593
It might work well for certain procedures,
but I haven't yet found a system that

12071612-0e62-411c-827f-70a8abeca654-1
01:02:19.593 --> 01:02:23.800
really works well for the kind of things
that we're doing throughout the body.

c666bbe3-971a-4ef5-b8e2-a2e27a0be7ed-0
01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:28.124
The radioaction system is a system that
we've looked at and it's interesting

c666bbe3-971a-4ef5-b8e2-a2e27a0be7ed-1
01:02:28.124 --> 01:02:32.180
because it's kind of dynamic radiation
protection and dedicated to a specific

c666bbe3-971a-4ef5-b8e2-a2e27a0be7ed-2
01:02:32.180 --> 01:02:32.440
area.

b5bd8ca6-6738-419f-9b8b-969e2943005a-0
01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:36.440
I think the potential limitations there
are you do it has to be built in.

4528f5c0-8bf8-4c10-a7b4-ab0be2ca242b-0
01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:39.320
It is installed into the image
intensifier.

5f8a421d-ed21-48b6-9e94-357317cb6575-0
01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:43.424
So that might be a limitation,
but that's the only one that I've seen

5f8a421d-ed21-48b6-9e94-357317cb6575-1
01:02:43.424 --> 01:02:45.360
that might be the most versatile.

72132c82-6ea8-4955-921b-b325e300d01a-0
01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:50.030
However you do it is not entirely level
as you do where a very thin piece of lead

72132c82-6ea8-4955-921b-b325e300d01a-1
01:02:50.030 --> 01:02:50.600
with that.

09f864b3-4b1f-48b9-b468-48499d40dfea-0
01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:57.061
Yeah,
I know that you know and I think

09f864b3-4b1f-48b9-b468-48499d40dfea-1
01:02:57.061 --> 01:03:01.480
radiology has so many different access
sites and so many different procedures.

f1da2028-d77f-4c87-8ab1-62dee3eded8a-0
01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:04.280
I think for cardiology, we're relatively,
you know,

f1da2028-d77f-4c87-8ab1-62dee3eded8a-1
01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:08.320
growing a radial access and certainly for
neuro it's kind of the same way.

df206dc7-c28a-4835-ae8e-c2e37c902c83-0
01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:14.035
But for these tech technology,
especially barrier technologies trying

df206dc7-c28a-4835-ae8e-c2e37c902c83-1
01:03:14.035 --> 01:03:19.400
when you're trying to work up underneath
the the I I, it becomes very difficult.

26dc1437-3ef5-447b-93ed-9472e0363a78-0
01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:22.707
You know,
if you're doing T cars or if you're

26dc1437-3ef5-447b-93ed-9472e0363a78-1
01:03:22.707 --> 01:03:25.760
orthopedics or you know,
some of those sub specialties.

474a3853-bc91-498a-a6aa-e0ef0286ed8b-0
01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:29.806
I think it's going to be a real challenge
with the barrier technologies to be able

474a3853-bc91-498a-a6aa-e0ef0286ed8b-1
01:03:29.806 --> 01:03:32.633
to to, you know,
to protect them and still be able to see

474a3853-bc91-498a-a6aa-e0ef0286ed8b-2
01:03:32.633 --> 01:03:33.560
what they're doing.

eaa44d1e-ae39-4215-942a-029618fbc864-0
01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:35.720
Yeah.

322b6bdf-3987-4a3d-b481-21954884cba0-0
01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:38.942
I mean,
the other group for cardiology are the

322b6bdf-3987-4a3d-b481-21954884cba0-1
01:03:38.942 --> 01:03:41.480
imagers for structural heart disease.

079d78f2-a5eb-4497-8194-4fa258cfe293-0
01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:46.000
You know,
those the TE holding the most important

079d78f2-a5eb-4497-8194-4fa258cfe293-1
01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.400
instrument in the in the room.

dd327248-1d13-462c-b5b6-b33769111202-0
01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:52.600
They're getting smoked on many of these
cases.

cfa2c336-14d4-41cd-a34b-7657e193220e-0
01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:56.558
And, you know, we've got some, you know,
made some advancements,

cfa2c336-14d4-41cd-a34b-7657e193220e-1
01:03:56.558 --> 01:03:59.480
but they're still getting way too much
radiation.

e21dcc2a-c2c1-4f07-8a5f-5f51228c1228-0
01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:00.840
We need to solve that.

be37d10a-681e-4117-8be2-828ec80c26b7-0
01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:04.640
I'm waiting for the robots.

743a39d3-2b50-48e8-b14b-b5980486d3fa-0
01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:07.000
OK.

b9e79317-8cd8-4d74-87e4-2f7559e66fa3-0
01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:08.040
Chris, do you have a question?

6d7f3fda-26bb-480f-a321-39c4f6d0f303-0
01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:13.730
Yeah, I just wanted to share that I,
I think it's really important to do

6d7f3fda-26bb-480f-a321-39c4f6d0f303-1
01:04:13.730 --> 01:04:17.135
exactly what ORSIF has done,
which is include us,

6d7f3fda-26bb-480f-a321-39c4f6d0f303-2
01:04:17.135 --> 01:04:22.310
because you have to remember if,
if cardiologist is doing 250 cases a year,

6d7f3fda-26bb-480f-a321-39c4f6d0f303-3
01:04:22.310 --> 01:04:23.400
we're doing 800.

bd4e91b7-3341-40ae-8e2c-2f86c9836ac0-0
01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:28.680
So orthopedically we're at risk and we're
not standing in what position.

e74b73a7-fc62-42f7-8017-f48690c54b47-0
01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:31.720
We're twisting, turning, moving, reaching,
stretching.

218858ab-09fb-4855-8c8b-57aae4870d1a-0
01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:36.233
And I think that to,
to include the the technologists and the

218858ab-09fb-4855-8c8b-57aae4870d1a-1
01:04:36.233 --> 01:04:41.520
allied support staff and in these
decisions is important in educating them.

8aeda14f-c07a-4290-b9f7-967b67541d7d-0
01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:43.040
Again, education, right.

34a8f8b8-8cc5-44ff-b3c2-3dde4e8e2b4f-0
01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:48.331
That goes a long way in the adoption
because I know when the new technology

34a8f8b8-8cc5-44ff-b3c2-3dde4e8e2b4f-1
01:04:48.331 --> 01:04:50.400
comes in a room, nobody wants to use it.

b36e9648-f4bc-4dcd-9d70-dbb76fce44da-0
01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:51.320
Why?

d1f7a6cf-36aa-4203-859d-cdd2c3ec01dc-0
01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:57.196
Because we don't know how to use it and
we're not afforded perhaps the extra time

d1f7a6cf-36aa-4203-859d-cdd2c3ec01dc-1
01:04:57.196 --> 01:04:58.200
that it takes.

d6811952-ed7d-467c-8f5d-8ae044ca3b62-0
01:04:58.280 --> 01:05:00.516
You know,
you hear the Velcro in the background,

d6811952-ed7d-467c-8f5d-8ae044ca3b62-1
01:05:00.516 --> 01:05:01.840
the doctors coming in, right?

1c4bad3e-fa9c-4823-8fc0-e4084a16386a-0
01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:05.720
And so you have to become proficient with
these these things.

e56fd144-cb3a-4607-9e67-636fbbb6f25c-0
01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:08.732
And I think then combining that, that,
that,

e56fd144-cb3a-4607-9e67-636fbbb6f25c-1
01:05:08.732 --> 01:05:12.614
that buy in by the allied support staff
and the training,

e56fd144-cb3a-4607-9e67-636fbbb6f25c-2
01:05:12.614 --> 01:05:17.099
I think you'd see adoption rates that go
up higher because that's,

e56fd144-cb3a-4607-9e67-636fbbb6f25c-3
01:05:17.099 --> 01:05:18.840
that's our barrier, right?

f0c1130d-aeda-47d6-b54b-20a092408952-0
01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:20.520
How do we set this thing up?

570cb455-bbb2-402a-bf62-90520941cec7-0
01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:22.880
Or what does he want to use or where does
he want to put it?

4c58ebdd-1c3a-4b41-b630-68a4cf68db5c-0
01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:26.760
Or, or she, you know,
these are their perspectives from us.

17208015-df31-45e2-bff1-7ab037f318c2-0
01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:30.640
So this kind of meeting is perfect for
that, right?

75f7a965-a7c8-4c11-a9f1-73fd7b1d58ac-0
01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:32.600
We're getting us involved.

f59e638e-197d-4b77-9385-732b0d69d107-0
01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:36.624
How often do your allied support staff
and, and cardiologists,

f59e638e-197d-4b77-9385-732b0d69d107-1
01:05:36.624 --> 01:05:39.120
radiologists get together in a conference?

3dde7266-64e0-435b-bcc3-1d528e45c11c-0
01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:40.880
Pretty rarely.

d5664ece-a3dc-411f-be0a-04db91b5f1fc-0
01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:45.440
And so that's,
that's why this meeting is so important.

8b3e30a9-f116-4aa8-a442-3d7b4039e9a1-0
01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:47.680
And I'm, I'm eager to see more like this.

3edcbaf4-5a63-40fb-97c7-f4ef545994bf-0
01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:49.720
I think it's really exciting.

604b311a-a2b4-43b0-bd88-03566e941182-0
01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:54.032
You know, everyone on this,
on this panel within their own meetings

604b311a-a2b4-43b0-bd88-03566e941182-1
01:05:54.032 --> 01:05:57.520
have brought radiation protection into
their meetings.

bc97e8e3-cc80-4e96-9440-d82a215c9baf-0
01:05:57.560 --> 01:06:02.550
And I think that's probably over the last
year and a half or so of being involved

bc97e8e3-cc80-4e96-9440-d82a215c9baf-1
01:06:02.550 --> 01:06:05.654
in this has,
has really been the biggest change is

bc97e8e3-cc80-4e96-9440-d82a215c9baf-2
01:06:05.654 --> 01:06:10.036
that people are now, you know,
beginning to understand enough to not be

bc97e8e3-cc80-4e96-9440-d82a215c9baf-3
01:06:10.036 --> 01:06:14.480
embarrassed to ask questions and, and,
and even tell about their issues.

07f9f5b9-214a-4035-b274-db932ee5e9f3-0
01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:17.578
So, you know,
I do think that that's one of the things

07f9f5b9-214a-4035-b274-db932ee5e9f3-1
01:06:17.578 --> 01:06:20.560
that that's hopefully they're going to
drive this forward.

502d18d9-5479-41eb-a823-345d83589968-0
01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:22.356
I do think,
especially with all the newer

502d18d9-5479-41eb-a823-345d83589968-1
01:06:22.356 --> 01:06:25.950
technologies that are out there, you know,
I think that's only going to that's only

502d18d9-5479-41eb-a823-345d83589968-2
01:06:25.950 --> 01:06:26.720
going to increase.

cf29ad2b-6081-40d2-8fdc-5f10f6241c07-0
01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:29.040
I think our numbers are only going to
improve.

470f3171-6817-4d3a-a80d-4b61a56b0610-0
01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:33.185
It's just, you know,
we've got to kind of continue that,

470f3171-6817-4d3a-a80d-4b61a56b0610-1
01:06:33.185 --> 01:06:34.640
continue that March.

55a4f38f-1d07-4912-91fe-61234d6c5187-0
01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:38.214
And I think everybody, like I say,
I think everybody on on this panel is,

55a4f38f-1d07-4912-91fe-61234d6c5187-1
01:06:38.214 --> 01:06:40.920
is brought in their meetings as part of
their meetings.

ace9e412-327c-46a9-9d41-ad067c10a0a4-0
01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:44.959
I know Cersei,
I know Bella was kind of instrumental in,

ace9e412-327c-46a9-9d41-ad067c10a0a4-1
01:06:44.959 --> 01:06:49.885
in a lot of the radiation protection
pavilion that they have Searcy and, and,

ace9e412-327c-46a9-9d41-ad067c10a0a4-2
01:06:49.885 --> 01:06:52.852
and,
and I think that's the kind of thing that

ace9e412-327c-46a9-9d41-ad067c10a0a4-3
01:06:52.852 --> 01:06:55.000
we need at most of these meetings.

a7eacc92-5d3a-4789-9f3a-c7bf2910d30d-0
01:06:55.760 --> 01:06:59.032
You know, Doctor Monk,
as he took over his presidency, this,

a7eacc92-5d3a-4789-9f3a-c7bf2910d30d-1
01:06:59.032 --> 01:07:01.983
this was, you know,
his platform of I'm going to bring

a7eacc92-5d3a-4789-9f3a-c7bf2910d30d-2
01:07:01.983 --> 01:07:04.880
radiation protection to protect these
younger people.

9bffd9aa-0a8a-4141-bbde-bf3481b3bf7b-0
01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:08.013
And,
and it's going to take a more senior

9bffd9aa-0a8a-4141-bbde-bf3481b3bf7b-1
01:07:08.013 --> 01:07:11.887
voice, you know,
like Doctor Oliver Olivier on this call

9bffd9aa-0a8a-4141-bbde-bf3481b3bf7b-2
01:07:11.887 --> 01:07:16.440
to, to say that we can't, you know,
we can't go backwards anymore.

94550df6-e0ad-45fc-bd39-ba62a5d99cba-0
01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:18.600
This is this has to be something that we
have pushed forward.

29092a48-34f6-4fc6-b3eb-ed400440bc25-0
01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:23.647
And I think your voice is really,
really resonate in that, you know,

29092a48-34f6-4fc6-b3eb-ed400440bc25-1
01:07:23.647 --> 01:07:24.960
change has to occur.

2fe786de-6e2e-4b51-b422-86c08ee902d2-0
01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:28.490
And I think that's the only way we're
really going to push the,

2fe786de-6e2e-4b51-b422-86c08ee902d2-1
01:07:28.490 --> 01:07:32.793
the hospital systems and those who are
cutting the checks to say that this is

2fe786de-6e2e-4b51-b422-86c08ee902d2-2
01:07:32.793 --> 01:07:36.545
just part of if we're going to do,
if we're going to do any kind of

2fe786de-6e2e-4b51-b422-86c08ee902d2-3
01:07:36.545 --> 01:07:40.241
procedures that require X-rays,
Part of that is we have to protect

2fe786de-6e2e-4b51-b422-86c08ee902d2-4
01:07:40.241 --> 01:07:41.400
everyone in the room.

54eea5a9-3678-4d67-aafc-9fe6c7e9e857-0
01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:44.775
And, and, and, and with,
with the newer technologies that are

54eea5a9-3678-4d67-aafc-9fe6c7e9e857-1
01:07:44.775 --> 01:07:45.320
available.

692e6d04-6e6f-4456-b120-da21aac56523-0
01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:50.800
You have to give a Bob have to give a
shout out to Brian Chambliss.

19e3a3de-dce8-4168-b34f-f2d3ffd973a8-0
01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:55.863
I think he's with your company and he was,
he was very instrumental in helping us

19e3a3de-dce8-4168-b34f-f2d3ffd973a8-1
01:07:55.863 --> 01:07:57.840
get this across the finish line.

c613ef3b-e38e-4250-b26c-22e52b6212d1-0
01:07:58.600 --> 01:08:02.461
And you know, one thing,
like like Chris said, you know, the, the,

c613ef3b-e38e-4250-b26c-22e52b6212d1-1
01:08:02.461 --> 01:08:05.572
the, the RTS and RNS,
they're doing the least in our,

c613ef3b-e38e-4250-b26c-22e52b6212d1-2
01:08:05.572 --> 01:08:08.799
in our system four to five times the
cases I do a week.

d71bd798-aa16-48b4-954b-8cb2e7be8c07-0
01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:13.427
So I went to the administrators and said,
listen, if you can make this a priority,

d71bd798-aa16-48b4-954b-8cb2e7be8c07-1
01:08:13.427 --> 01:08:15.320
it's going to get out in the community.

a970f1ab-c5bb-42fd-ad36-6583b4388839-0
01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:19.560
It's going to lead to better RT and RRT
and RN retention.

d670ac37-8672-48e1-b982-ad401883bc78-0
01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:21.868
And I think, you know,
because it's hard for them,

d670ac37-8672-48e1-b982-ad401883bc78-1
01:08:21.868 --> 01:08:23.480
they're always looking for the dollars,
right?

7340fbf8-e87c-420a-9ea6-6be29187bb27-0
01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:24.640
The return on investment.

1ad2824c-579d-41bb-b2d0-44c8b52dc241-0
01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:29.440
That's kind of not going to be probably
something we can measure here, correct?

abbc7e9c-8295-46d9-8366-6cc7fd913a8a-0
01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:34.273
But if you go at it with that attitude
and, and, and you know, the, the, the,

abbc7e9c-8295-46d9-8366-6cc7fd913a8a-1
01:08:34.273 --> 01:08:37.877
the system putting out the,
the correct message that they care,

abbc7e9c-8295-46d9-8366-6cc7fd913a8a-2
01:08:37.877 --> 01:08:39.680
it's going to lead to retention.

51211372-1c6d-4430-8943-fd42cfefe194-0
01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:43.975
And I'm hoping that it'll also lead to
other folks coming from other systems to

51211372-1c6d-4430-8943-fd42cfefe194-1
01:08:43.975 --> 01:08:45.040
want to work with us.

15e007b7-2b30-49e5-929b-792a83ba8244-0
01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:48.160
But again, yeah, shout out to Brian.

a5ed034c-4543-4b83-ae40-db86aaa66279-0
01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:52.009
He he really helped us tremendously and
opened my eyes and helped me get this

a5ed034c-4543-4b83-ae40-db86aaa66279-1
01:08:52.009 --> 01:08:54.280
across the finish line at at our
institution.

d5e280b4-890f-482a-bdaf-43edc471052a-0
01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:56.280
Great.

d193f8b0-8ca1-4fda-9850-b028e538b691-0
01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:01.080
Anyone else on that?

b71bd7cd-2cf4-4216-8917-e1374b6f618a-0
01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:07.108
So just just wanted to say that we were
in Barcelona for Cersei last week and one

b71bd7cd-2cf4-4216-8917-e1374b6f618a-1
01:09:07.108 --> 01:09:12.183
of the things that is happening with the
annual meetings is in Cersei we had a

b71bd7cd-2cf4-4216-8917-e1374b6f618a-2
01:09:12.183 --> 01:09:16.360
radiation village where all our industry
partners were together.

7b1f0475-558d-4ebf-97e0-d068025bd0a3-0
01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:20.595
You could go around and you know,
chat up with virtually everyone,

7b1f0475-558d-4ebf-97e0-d068025bd0a3-1
01:09:20.595 --> 01:09:25.217
look at different options because at the
end of the day you were asking for

7b1f0475-558d-4ebf-97e0-d068025bd0a3-2
01:09:25.217 --> 01:09:28.320
shielding techniques and,
and the downsides of it.

8f9b68e4-6736-405b-ac74-f65f18ac7d55-0
01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:32.410
You know,
we tend to sometime access the poker vein

8f9b68e4-6736-405b-ac74-f65f18ac7d55-1
01:09:32.410 --> 01:09:37.760
percutaneously across the liver or some
of the complex aortic work.

7c92699f-6bbd-4844-a2fe-a229502d233a-0
01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:42.427
I tend to do, you know,
a subclavian or anterior axillary access

7c92699f-6bbd-4844-a2fe-a229502d233a-1
01:09:42.427 --> 01:09:47.535
so that the sheath is not long and,
and then you're extremely close to the

7c92699f-6bbd-4844-a2fe-a229502d233a-2
01:09:47.535 --> 01:09:48.080
patient.

1cdcbf46-cb0d-4c78-a802-99f9f5824b6f-0
01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:50.880
So that radiation village was a great
idea.

6ead0f10-4033-4ef9-a061-f930b8a1a925-0
01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:56.231
And Bella added on at the British society,
we, we have a workshop, you know, we,

6ead0f10-4033-4ef9-a061-f930b8a1a925-1
01:09:56.231 --> 01:10:00.923
we just didn't have workshop for certain
devices or certain aspects of

6ead0f10-4033-4ef9-a061-f930b8a1a925-2
01:10:00.923 --> 01:10:04.623
intervention,
but also a complete workshop on radiation

6ead0f10-4033-4ef9-a061-f930b8a1a925-3
01:10:04.623 --> 01:10:09.843
protection associated with simulators,
which kind of give you an idea of where

6ead0f10-4033-4ef9-a061-f930b8a1a925-4
01:10:09.843 --> 01:10:15.327
you're standing and how much of radiation
you get as to where you're stood next to

6ead0f10-4033-4ef9-a061-f930b8a1a925-5
01:10:15.327 --> 01:10:16.120
the machine.

6b7f1d00-53e3-4ef6-85f1-ea1788dfc8a1-0
01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:23.082
So I think a great educational both from
the British Society and, and Searcy, yeah,

6b7f1d00-53e3-4ef6-85f1-ea1788dfc8a1-1
01:10:23.082 --> 01:10:24.160
that's great.

f22d8125-1698-4603-8e41-a3a7bb73c2ac-0
01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:27.640
These focus summits I think are really
are really helping as well.

c7cd25e9-1d37-4da9-ab86-7ea3188332c1-0
01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:31.974
I know Doctor Miller had it,
it's guy last year and, and,

c7cd25e9-1d37-4da9-ab86-7ea3188332c1-1
01:10:31.974 --> 01:10:37.280
and Doctor Spratz having one in two weeks
at his meeting in in London.

3c890c86-a3c1-4856-9e38-7b0e3ef9d51b-0
01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:40.714
That's, you know,
choosing 5 topics to tackle and one of

3c890c86-a3c1-4856-9e38-7b0e3ef9d51b-1
01:10:40.714 --> 01:10:42.080
those is radiation safety.

152db8bf-968b-41eb-b4d0-810650eee6be-0
01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:46.728
So, so we're starting to see it in the,
you know, in the society meetings and,

152db8bf-968b-41eb-b4d0-810650eee6be-1
01:10:46.728 --> 01:10:51.023
and looking forward to, you know,
the society consensus papers that that

152db8bf-968b-41eb-b4d0-810650eee6be-2
01:10:51.023 --> 01:10:54.847
hopefully will come out again,
shed more light on, on, you know,

152db8bf-968b-41eb-b4d0-810650eee6be-3
01:10:54.847 --> 01:10:58.613
it's time for time for change and time to
find, you know, what,

152db8bf-968b-41eb-b4d0-810650eee6be-4
01:10:58.613 --> 01:11:02.320
what we need to really get everybody,
get everybody protected.

c0cace5e-1aec-4a4a-b5a2-3aeefa843a72-0
01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:04.400
Yeah.

97f6c350-0270-4bee-8416-1cb1a57a59fe-0
01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:06.120
Let me just add one thing.

7691c643-b207-44df-896b-ce49270b3eea-0
01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:08.960
And Doctor Muck mentioned something and I
heard it earlier.

dd7b4e65-84dc-4812-9418-205b032ffa83-0
01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:12.357
You know,
I tell my students when they're being

dd7b4e65-84dc-4812-9418-205b032ffa83-1
01:11:12.357 --> 01:11:15.600
recruited, look at their, look at their,
look at the lead.

ae3437ef-77e4-448d-bc2e-c53e530686fa-0
01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:22.035
Do you want to see how much your hospital
cares about you and how the department

ae3437ef-77e4-448d-bc2e-c53e530686fa-1
01:11:22.035 --> 01:11:23.360
just look at the lead?

0db750d1-68ba-4395-8a33-f58185b9582b-0
01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:31.016
And so, so when someone said, you know,
to use PPE, radiation protection,

0db750d1-68ba-4395-8a33-f58185b9582b-1
01:11:31.016 --> 01:11:35.946
safety equipment as a recruitment tool,
you know,

0db750d1-68ba-4395-8a33-f58185b9582b-2
01:11:35.946 --> 01:11:39.200
my students are looking for that.

ca58b0c8-5ec1-4046-bc8d-790eee36f512-0
01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:42.472
They're going in the room where they'll
be spending, you know,

ca58b0c8-5ec1-4046-bc8d-790eee36f512-1
01:11:42.472 --> 01:11:44.040
the next few years of their life.

123a3e1a-81b4-401e-b794-c2dae1abca62-0
01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:48.993
And that that's the different,
that could be the difference between

123a3e1a-81b4-401e-b794-c2dae1abca62-1
01:11:48.993 --> 01:11:52.598
taking a job or not taking a job,
especially as we're, we're seeing this,

123a3e1a-81b4-401e-b794-c2dae1abca62-2
01:11:52.598 --> 01:11:54.840
this increased awareness of radiation
safety.

2cbc1653-d003-4930-a399-8e361b31c96c-0
01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:58.200
So there's some potential there which
I've never thought of.

0b986078-94d9-4610-b54f-5cb15941ba22-0
01:11:58.200 --> 01:12:00.400
So that's why I love these meetings.

9993b7ba-8949-4f9a-ab7d-42c1a22781ec-0
01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:02.200
Yeah.

aa2281ff-1552-427c-97a7-22a2b8f64644-0
01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:07.619
You know, it makes me think, Bob, we've,
we've sort of done studies related to the

aa2281ff-1552-427c-97a7-22a2b8f64644-1
01:12:07.619 --> 01:12:11.537
radiation etcetera,
but we really haven't looked at sort of

aa2281ff-1552-427c-97a7-22a2b8f64644-2
01:12:11.537 --> 01:12:14.280
occupational quality of life, if you will.

2f8c20bc-80b9-4e90-a8a4-3756fe00530e-0
01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:16.920
And there's,
there's all kinds of tools to do that.

9299dce7-1386-4b73-ac11-0c4001ce9d59-0
01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:21.080
And it would be, you know,
we should do that.

ea5db8a3-5cbf-4b76-a920-f3db985b4ea6-0
01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:25.386
And it may be another sort of lever for
hospitals to, hey,

ea5db8a3-5cbf-4b76-a920-f3db985b4ea6-1
01:12:25.386 --> 01:12:30.258
not only are there fewer orthopedic
issues and sick days, etcetera,

ea5db8a3-5cbf-4b76-a920-f3db985b4ea6-2
01:12:30.258 --> 01:12:33.912
but listen,
they're their occupational Wellness is

ea5db8a3-5cbf-4b76-a920-f3db985b4ea6-3
01:12:33.912 --> 01:12:37.494
substantially better, which which does,
you know,

ea5db8a3-5cbf-4b76-a920-f3db985b4ea6-4
01:12:37.494 --> 01:12:41.649
that translates into fewer people leaving,
less turnover,

ea5db8a3-5cbf-4b76-a920-f3db985b4ea6-5
01:12:41.649 --> 01:12:45.160
which turns into what they care about the
money.

548b6855-1b94-4fe3-8d62-2c495416d41c-0
01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:50.756
Yeah, retention, recruitment, obviously,
you know, we are,

548b6855-1b94-4fe3-8d62-2c495416d41c-1
01:12:50.756 --> 01:12:54.672
we have a massive shortage here in the US
of cardiologist,

548b6855-1b94-4fe3-8d62-2c495416d41c-2
01:12:54.672 --> 01:12:58.522
probably vascular surgeons,
really anybody doing complex,

548b6855-1b94-4fe3-8d62-2c495416d41c-3
01:12:58.522 --> 01:13:02.040
complex work and,
and long hours and emergency work.

779ff5b0-2c8c-4eea-947c-03c4e52ba155-0
01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:04.783
And, and so you're right,
if we can recruit,

779ff5b0-2c8c-4eea-947c-03c4e52ba155-1
01:13:04.783 --> 01:13:09.661
if we can use it for recruiting tool and
retention tool, I think the hospitals,

779ff5b0-2c8c-4eea-947c-03c4e52ba155-2
01:13:09.661 --> 01:13:13.320
you would think that that would really be
a big, a big win.

d2ec91c6-1d75-45d6-b92d-daf15ef7ebe0-0
01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:16.771
You know,
the big issue is trying to find out how

d2ec91c6-1d75-45d6-b92d-daf15ef7ebe0-1
01:13:16.771 --> 01:13:17.800
to record that data.

e21e03d1-26e3-4b11-b5d5-818cfc47e3a5-0
01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:24.360
And I know we're trying to put together
an updated economic impact paper together.

ae43e99e-7b1b-4b1d-a457-a8f5f8252bb8-0
01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:29.913
The original one was on Orsaf and done by
Mike Seymour will be here tomorrow,

ae43e99e-7b1b-4b1d-a457-a8f5f8252bb8-1
01:13:29.913 --> 01:13:32.120
But but we need an updated one.

c63c151e-cf8f-4ba9-b36f-04a6f3c17b46-0
01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:35.520
What does it cost when you lose a
physician, when you lose a staff member?

e31edddb-fa65-44b7-83e9-026c2e1de1d8-0
01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:40.120
You know, how do you, you know,
how can you use this for recruitment?

5a2886e2-5663-4234-8124-ff171fb67793-0
01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:42.200
How can it actually have a financial
impact?

67a3d28c-7e44-4499-b8c9-15c4c511cff1-0
01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:44.613
Cuz that's ultimately what,
what they're going to, you know,

67a3d28c-7e44-4499-b8c9-15c4c511cff1-1
01:13:44.613 --> 01:13:45.800
what they're going to look at.

ab376ae9-c1ba-4fcd-855f-fc24bc5759dc-0
01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:50.411
And I think ultimately it helps patient
care because you don't have tired fatigue,

ab376ae9-c1ba-4fcd-855f-fc24bc5759dc-1
01:13:50.411 --> 01:13:53.912
you know, doctors who are, you know,
who are hurting and, and,

ab376ae9-c1ba-4fcd-855f-fc24bc5759dc-2
01:13:53.912 --> 01:13:57.356
and you just wonder if they're,
they're not making, you know,

ab376ae9-c1ba-4fcd-855f-fc24bc5759dc-3
01:13:57.356 --> 01:14:00.301
decisions that,
that are changing their algorithms a

ab376ae9-c1ba-4fcd-855f-fc24bc5759dc-4
01:14:00.301 --> 01:14:04.246
little bit because, you know,
they are tired and they're all ready for

ab376ae9-c1ba-4fcd-855f-fc24bc5759dc-5
01:14:04.246 --> 01:14:05.080
the day to end.

1d546173-cb19-469b-bfa7-6d1d333b8d64-0
01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:07.680
And, you know,
you hate to put a finger on that because

1d546173-cb19-469b-bfa7-6d1d333b8d64-1
01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:09.680
you don't know what's going on in
people's heads.

90d47b46-ed6e-4555-b927-1d33ecee2f37-0
01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:16.320
But, but, but again, I think, you know,
we need, we need rested teams.

394a1f63-0f17-4035-8645-0d44575a362f-0
01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:20.152
And, and the only way to do that,
I think is going to be to change

394a1f63-0f17-4035-8645-0d44575a362f-1
01:14:20.152 --> 01:14:22.616
environment and in some way so that it's
a,

394a1f63-0f17-4035-8645-0d44575a362f-2
01:14:22.616 --> 01:14:25.360
it's a little bit better environment to
work in.

db76caa5-4543-46a5-8c87-fec0e29c1e47-0
01:14:26.120 --> 01:14:27.560
I think we have to force this issue.

4e46be62-29c4-4b57-b439-b56c1ebe84e0-0
01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:28.840
I think someone stated this earlier.

006f2cce-20aa-403d-a1d6-9f5aeb163bce-0
01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:31.060
I mean, you're not going to send,
you know,

006f2cce-20aa-403d-a1d6-9f5aeb163bce-1
01:14:31.060 --> 01:14:34.320
a person out on a football field without
a helmet and proper gear.

3c310949-7fed-4557-9556-537fc087a9a2-0
01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:37.280
And, and this is well documented.

239f4cc9-cdd9-40bc-9d02-c849eec87b94-0
01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:39.531
I mean,
I think there was a sky survey I read

239f4cc9-cdd9-40bc-9d02-c849eec87b94-1
01:14:39.531 --> 01:14:41.440
about that was done a couple years ago.

f2349438-1960-41aa-9507-26f0a846b6d1-0
01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:43.909
You know,
like 20% or so people reported not

f2349438-1960-41aa-9507-26f0a846b6d1-1
01:14:43.909 --> 01:14:46.440
showing up at work because of the
orthopedic issue.

806aa18d-e976-42ba-b80d-103bee1c6e4a-0
01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:48.560
I mean, that's one in five people.

144bf1e1-1c58-4467-b5b5-6c5100095683-0
01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:49.720
That's pretty significant.

ce8a41da-0385-46a0-99ff-e19b86741b25-0
01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:52.280
And that's probably just scratching the
surface.

d620a53c-5439-4f0e-a54c-7918ebe9fcb5-0
01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:57.124
So I, I think we have to demand as,
as a special or as a group of

d620a53c-5439-4f0e-a54c-7918ebe9fcb5-1
01:14:57.124 --> 01:15:01.580
interventionists who do these procedures
that this is not optional,

d620a53c-5439-4f0e-a54c-7918ebe9fcb5-2
01:15:01.580 --> 01:15:02.760
this is mandatory.

e9e04f83-5917-48e0-977d-251e0f7b9985-0
01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:07.354
And we can't put ourselves, you know,
we're putting ourselves and our own

e9e04f83-5917-48e0-977d-251e0f7b9985-1
01:15:07.354 --> 01:15:11.080
health on the line in the long term by
not having proper protection.

1640abd6-4bc3-4259-84ed-3d9bf3661b0a-0
01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:16.072
Yeah, I know it's,
it's one of those things that, you know,

1640abd6-4bc3-4259-84ed-3d9bf3661b0a-1
01:15:16.072 --> 01:15:19.268
we, we like to say on, you know, I would,
I would do this, but, you know,

1640abd6-4bc3-4259-84ed-3d9bf3661b0a-2
01:15:19.268 --> 01:15:19.960
would we really?

782bea8e-9924-4b32-a864-b91da8678a4a-0
01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:22.360
And it's fascinating.

ef386288-50a3-4f45-9364-9e5e4f1fe3cd-0
01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:27.487
Me and Doctor Isaac did a webinar and we
asked, we polled people,

ef386288-50a3-4f45-9364-9e5e4f1fe3cd-1
01:15:27.487 --> 01:15:31.653
if you did not get the most updated
radiation protection in your lab,

ef386288-50a3-4f45-9364-9e5e4f1fe3cd-2
01:15:31.653 --> 01:15:33.320
would you walk off your job?

b6a79063-4a53-492d-88de-237e493c17e7-0
01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:37.417
And, and we thought, you know,
chances of people actually saying, yeah,

b6a79063-4a53-492d-88de-237e493c17e7-1
01:15:37.417 --> 01:15:40.477
if I don't get, you know,
whatever I'm demanding for radiation

b6a79063-4a53-492d-88de-237e493c17e7-2
01:15:40.477 --> 01:15:42.080
protection, I'll walk off my job.

ee25515d-7693-4e1c-a467-031abc6e8c66-0
01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:45.640
You think it'd be actually very low,
But it was 70%.

abc888bd-8eee-4fed-8708-ed796bcbb3b4-0
01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:47.785
Now,
whether or not they'd really do that or

abc888bd-8eee-4fed-8708-ed796bcbb3b4-1
01:15:47.785 --> 01:15:49.120
not, you know, I don't know.

ad3b5043-95e6-4258-8ef2-e26853107551-0
01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:52.446
But but the fact that at least in their
mind saying, yeah, I mean,

ad3b5043-95e6-4258-8ef2-e26853107551-1
01:15:52.446 --> 01:15:54.600
that should that's the appropriate thing
to do.

434b765f-845b-4644-85ca-4566cb2f44d1-0
01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:57.920
That's really the the,
the right thing to do.

1f1ae094-ed66-48f7-a8b0-657727520627-0
01:15:58.080 --> 01:16:04.036
And and so I do think getting, you know,
get getting a big voice of everyone in

1f1ae094-ed66-48f7-a8b0-657727520627-1
01:16:04.036 --> 01:16:10.216
these fields to say that that this is a
demand that we have to have and, and, and,

1f1ae094-ed66-48f7-a8b0-657727520627-2
01:16:10.216 --> 01:16:15.280
you know, round X-rays, you know,
certainly to me just makes sense.

8d465e9f-2f10-4af9-b199-256cd207e0f1-0
01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:22.759
Well, Bob, I hope hopefully soon,
this consensus paper,

8d465e9f-2f10-4af9-b199-256cd207e0f1-1
01:16:22.759 --> 01:16:26.153
which is multi specialty, moldy society,
every,

8d465e9f-2f10-4af9-b199-256cd207e0f1-2
01:16:26.153 --> 01:16:29.618
every specialty here is represented and
it will,

8d465e9f-2f10-4af9-b199-256cd207e0f1-3
01:16:29.618 --> 01:16:33.719
it will be a call to action and it will
not be equivocal.

6cf458ae-cf26-4d7a-bd50-1f0282e76045-0
01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:40.591
And I think the other thing that's going
to come up in five years potentially is

6cf458ae-cf26-4d7a-bd50-1f0282e76045-1
01:16:40.591 --> 01:16:46.583
if you work in a hospital that won't step
up and pay for these and you come down

6cf458ae-cf26-4d7a-bd50-1f0282e76045-2
01:16:46.583 --> 01:16:52.426
with cervical injury, lumbar injury,
there's going to be liability and there's

6cf458ae-cf26-4d7a-bd50-1f0282e76045-3
01:16:52.426 --> 01:16:54.719
going to be no way around that.

3a5ebf1a-90a6-48bc-a309-edad557f460e-0
01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:01.140
Yeah,
I think just kind of been being being in

3a5ebf1a-90a6-48bc-a309-edad557f460e-1
01:17:01.140 --> 01:17:02.840
this for a while after my injury.

b5c20c02-6120-41c4-a889-a51cd3a59ed1-0
01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:06.941
You know, the question was, would it,
you know,

b5c20c02-6120-41c4-a889-a51cd3a59ed1-1
01:17:06.941 --> 01:17:11.846
could we actually create change and,
and make it so that there, you know,

b5c20c02-6120-41c4-a889-a51cd3a59ed1-2
01:17:11.846 --> 01:17:15.160
there is a passion for it because we're
all busy.

2b49351e-0d0b-4296-bcb3-a2b35b60675b-0
01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:16.400
I mean, I think that's the thing.

2a9f5513-be95-449d-adeb-23d8e04b4cae-0
01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:20.243
And that was one of the issues that a lot
of us have is we just get busy to to

2a9f5513-be95-449d-adeb-23d8e04b4cae-1
01:17:20.243 --> 01:17:22.920
fight for something that we know we need
to fight for.

9a9e231e-1880-49f7-b726-1f5d48d9ae96-0
01:17:22.920 --> 01:17:25.320
But we'd really like to just get through
our work and go home.

34a8f8d0-182a-45ec-bfdc-81bede5ac77a-0
01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:30.002
And and so, you know, you know,
thank the Lord for for people like,

34a8f8d0-182a-45ec-bfdc-81bede5ac77a-1
01:17:30.002 --> 01:17:32.783
you know,
people on this call who are really

34a8f8d0-182a-45ec-bfdc-81bede5ac77a-2
01:17:32.783 --> 01:17:37.357
becoming the voice of, you know,
our profession and taking the time to do

34a8f8d0-182a-45ec-bfdc-81bede5ac77a-3
01:17:37.357 --> 01:17:41.250
it because I know it's,
it's extra work on time of your normal

34a8f8d0-182a-45ec-bfdc-81bede5ac77a-4
01:17:41.250 --> 01:17:41.560
work.

ce99d315-2c04-4483-88aa-9c9872b0141c-0
01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:43.840
And it's, you know, it's a lot.

03118110-3cc7-46e1-8092-1ae46e7d92e2-0
01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:50.200
It's easier doing things as a team,
even if not within in house team.

cc86c8a2-fc9b-4525-82c5-f472dfb4cf54-0
01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:54.476
But like when I was asking for a lead
shield years back,

cc86c8a2-fc9b-4525-82c5-f472dfb4cf54-1
01:17:54.476 --> 01:17:58.904
I was almost seen as a Nutter and
probably was very close,

cc86c8a2-fc9b-4525-82c5-f472dfb4cf54-2
01:17:58.904 --> 01:18:01.080
not getting a consultant job.

a896d198-ee3d-4a1d-9736-f19e47063337-0
01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:05.968
Whereas now if I'd asked for it,
I don't think anybody would be looking at

a896d198-ee3d-4a1d-9736-f19e47063337-1
01:18:05.968 --> 01:18:07.600
me as some sort of a weirdo.

87cbe7db-b7dd-41c2-a653-6a0eb96ad73e-0
01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:08.920
It would be the norm.

46ffef50-180f-4c9b-afd9-fa52305aa96c-0
01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:13.320
But that's a huge step that's we've come
through.

151b93e8-553c-4800-80b7-65c65b35ca89-0
01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:15.520
So progress is happening.

5dba88dc-05c4-4f13-a406-ccbaa9d6af4e-0
01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:18.402
But I think unity,
having multiple colleagues,

5dba88dc-05c4-4f13-a406-ccbaa9d6af4e-1
01:18:18.402 --> 01:18:22.880
not even necessarily within the same
trust, but even other trusts helps.

96cea840-14b4-4295-9364-8350e6cde44a-0
01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:24.760
It pushes this momentum through.

4bbd1c9e-da44-40fb-8f47-b5949a0b224b-0
01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:28.229
So if your hospital's doing it,
the other hospital will be forced to do

4bbd1c9e-da44-40fb-8f47-b5949a0b224b-1
01:18:28.229 --> 01:18:29.000
it and so forth.

60fa0441-15f7-4edf-8041-fbbf7d1a0619-0
01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:33.784
Whereas if it's just one site on its own
or one doctor by himself, it,

60fa0441-15f7-4edf-8041-fbbf7d1a0619-1
01:18:33.784 --> 01:18:34.800
it doesn't work.

1a4c4bb1-966c-4c86-b4ef-ce6399f24264-0
01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:39.640
Momentum works through movement and
motion and multiple people voicing.

e9ea41eb-aa5a-44df-8403-f734917c8e85-0
01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:42.217
Even if your hospital doesn't quite get
it yet, it,

e9ea41eb-aa5a-44df-8403-f734917c8e85-1
01:18:42.217 --> 01:18:46.232
it doesn't mean that you stopped talking
about it because maybe another hospital

e9ea41eb-aa5a-44df-8403-f734917c8e85-2
01:18:46.232 --> 01:18:47.720
will then get it and so forth.

7e122747-9a85-4090-883a-36e6cfb842fd-0
01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:55.361
And that will help your 'cause I know on
this call a lot of you have, you know,

7e122747-9a85-4090-883a-36e6cfb842fd-1
01:18:55.361 --> 01:19:01.664
the passion for this space,
but do you have partners who are just

7e122747-9a85-4090-883a-36e6cfb842fd-2
01:19:01.664 --> 01:19:09.401
like, it's not for me And what is their,
what is their reasoning for that within

7e122747-9a85-4090-883a-36e6cfb842fd-3
01:19:09.401 --> 01:19:12.839
the site to me and other colleagues?

9e719c18-dbf9-45b9-82f5-f459dbffff85-0
01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:18.720
Yeah, Like, yeah, within your practice,
if you, you have the passion for it.

02320b2b-4faa-4480-a85e-5409afe91445-0
01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:20.880
But I guess they don't have the passion
for it.

185024b8-4602-4eea-8b83-52602ec25047-0
01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:23.400
They, they're not really looking to,
to change.

82bda709-f4d0-409d-be19-9882e07263af-0
01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:27.240
Is it because they're just busy or
because they just don't care?

edcf025d-0732-4267-991e-8d19d9b3f726-0
01:19:27.240 --> 01:19:30.240
They think they're bulletproof or lack of
knowledge?

e18553d2-23e8-415b-b7e7-bcc80b9112d9-0
01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:36.380
It started off so when I was a junior,
so I got the consultant or the staff job

e18553d2-23e8-415b-b7e7-bcc80b9112d9-1
01:19:36.380 --> 01:19:42.168
in the same hospital I trained and when I
was a trainee I I was very psychotic

e18553d2-23e8-415b-b7e7-bcc80b9112d9-2
01:19:42.168 --> 01:19:43.560
about these things.

7a1f36f6-674f-46fc-91c9-88ed719c85c6-0
01:19:43.560 --> 01:19:46.840
But I love numbers and I love data and I
love my dose.

284f4c1d-cf9a-4d05-938a-47b94cb5c280-0
01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:52.360
So they were like, OK,
there's something wrong with her.

25d6051d-8a24-4317-998e-438e57fe92e8-0
01:19:52.680 --> 01:19:55.920
Plus I was the only female around,
so that didn't help matters.

165c954e-7a60-4119-9410-db0b836586f1-0
01:19:57.280 --> 01:20:00.680
So asking for things, everyone's like,
oh for God's sake, it's not a big deal,

165c954e-7a60-4119-9410-db0b836586f1-1
01:20:00.680 --> 01:20:01.800
nothing's going to happen.

425a27a8-f737-453f-92d8-8769e7cc8c0c-0
01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:06.713
But then slowly what actually changed
things wasn't me going on about it is

425a27a8-f737-453f-92d8-8769e7cc8c0c-1
01:20:06.713 --> 01:20:10.040
because one colleague got cataracts and
he was only 42.

c570b50a-1dfb-415d-93c7-ccfc4264c78c-0
01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:15.000
And then few years later another
colleague started getting blood.

aeb5e901-78ba-49f6-8e90-1a0ed375e3ee-0
01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:19.320
Funny vision and Lord behold cataracts
again.

7c39ac2a-f28c-4fe4-ad5f-100c60229f42-0
01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:23.480
And that's one kind of like, oh God,
she's actually telling the truth.

1d28d4e5-7c31-42db-a52d-cbc1266434be-0
01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:26.440
She was just saying this is right.

6a8f521e-970c-436d-9d89-9ec2b316d6d1-0
01:20:26.440 --> 01:20:27.000
I'm God.

28a6dc68-f486-4bd6-84ba-85147e2582ad-0
01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:28.480
And I was like, don't worry.

473a7408-3a92-416f-a24c-f7ed30016cdd-0
01:20:28.480 --> 01:20:30.640
You don't need to say I told you so don't
worry.

601d1b7b-800a-457a-b923-62116b114921-0
01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:33.560
I'm not going to say it,
but I think that's what it is.

1dc79aea-854b-40a4-9f15-4f9e2d39e025-0
01:20:33.560 --> 01:20:35.880
It's lack of knowledge and awareness.

1aeaf3d2-58ff-4b9c-98ac-6cbe11e7a418-0
01:20:35.880 --> 01:20:39.631
And because you haven't seen it,
you haven't heard of anybody having a

1aeaf3d2-58ff-4b9c-98ac-6cbe11e7a418-1
01:20:39.631 --> 01:20:41.640
problem, you assume no problems exist.

f79d3a0e-c8cb-44be-bd79-2908a8a6d46c-0
01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:45.517
But then the moment we had, you know,
these two colleagues and then another

f79d3a0e-c8cb-44be-bd79-2908a8a6d46c-1
01:20:45.517 --> 01:20:49.293
person had some another problem and then
it becomes reality actually, oh,

f79d3a0e-c8cb-44be-bd79-2908a8a6d46c-2
01:20:49.293 --> 01:20:51.640
people amongst my generation having
problems.

42ad42d7-5357-4c51-b04d-883b8661cd43-0
01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:52.840
It's real.

7537b297-94e7-4448-812c-062fc8b69258-0
01:20:56.440 --> 01:21:00.760
I think it has to be a combination of
education and regulation.

1a649ff1-fdf1-4cd7-9b49-0ba38ecd1175-0
01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:07.240
And as people involved in the process,
we have to push it.

f4f577c1-74e3-4fe0-91e8-8856c13ed2b3-0
01:21:07.840 --> 01:21:11.931
I mean at least at least the across the
pond here,

f4f577c1-74e3-4fe0-91e8-8856c13ed2b3-1
01:21:11.931 --> 01:21:18.269
regulation will then push hospitals in
order to provide what is expected to be

f4f577c1-74e3-4fe0-91e8-8856c13ed2b3-2
01:21:18.269 --> 01:21:21.879
provided and and that's not easy to come
in.

23ff9e86-4444-44b6-b076-c231db9a1949-0
01:21:21.880 --> 01:21:25.515
So if they go hand in hand,
education and regulation,

23ff9e86-4444-44b6-b076-c231db9a1949-1
01:21:25.515 --> 01:21:28.680
then that that will lead us to the end
result.

7b1c4db3-1551-45f7-a12a-e7b59648f2d8-0
01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:35.520
I feel who who regulate in over there?

6cf65af7-f479-4726-a3e5-5377482be3d1-0
01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:41.448
Who is the regulator of your So the
regular every, every,

6cf65af7-f479-4726-a3e5-5377482be3d1-1
01:21:41.448 --> 01:21:49.320
every hospital has a medical physics
department to look at individual doses.

b82a15ec-ffcf-402f-bbb6-69c7eaf769cd-0
01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:53.145
As I said before,
they are emailed to the people who have

b82a15ec-ffcf-402f-bbb6-69c7eaf769cd-1
01:21:53.145 --> 01:21:55.520
the dosage badges and they regulate.

5b1f0938-98cf-436b-bd0f-276762584acc-0
01:21:55.520 --> 01:22:00.802
So there has to be all the aprons will
have to be checked or cracks and stuff

5b1f0938-98cf-436b-bd0f-276762584acc-1
01:22:00.802 --> 01:22:01.480
like that.

165f8077-4298-45df-abc6-6aae887bb3a5-0
01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:07.280
And they make sure that that that is done
in a, in a constant manner.

7365534e-e735-4480-a714-0470ad17b229-0
01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:13.209
And every year the machines are checked
to to see that the amount of radiation

7365534e-e735-4480-a714-0470ad17b229-1
01:22:13.209 --> 01:22:17.000
that they are spitting out is,
is OK and acceptable.

3a046cbb-83c7-4aac-af2d-1a0d6083efc6-0
01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:21.042
So you have those step wedge filters
through which you're passing the

3a046cbb-83c7-4aac-af2d-1a0d6083efc6-1
01:22:21.042 --> 01:22:25.200
radiation to see how it's worth working
and models and stuff like that.

c1ef644c-0454-4324-8250-bde3fbb8bde7-0
01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:30.682
So it's a combination of that and, and,
and then the education that us as

c1ef644c-0454-4324-8250-bde3fbb8bde7-1
01:22:30.682 --> 01:22:35.276
societies and, and,
and the royal colleges and others try and

c1ef644c-0454-4324-8250-bde3fbb8bde7-2
01:22:35.276 --> 01:22:36.240
push through.

25f2d47d-70b0-4953-be0f-b98739a3e3e6-0
01:22:36.680 --> 01:22:39.294
I think that's,
that's the only way to make inroads,

25f2d47d-70b0-4953-be0f-b98739a3e3e6-1
01:22:39.294 --> 01:22:39.640
I feel.

7d6d808a-d4f6-44fa-b919-0ab3df680415-0
01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:41.738
Yeah,
I feel like we can learn a lot from you

7d6d808a-d4f6-44fa-b919-0ab3df680415-1
01:22:41.738 --> 01:22:43.200
because ours is very fractionated.

90be2d1e-251f-4bab-a58f-216ab73d7515-0
01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:47.378
We have some extremely involved radiation
safety officers and,

90be2d1e-251f-4bab-a58f-216ab73d7515-1
01:22:47.378 --> 01:22:51.291
and involved hospitals,
and then we have others that just,

90be2d1e-251f-4bab-a58f-216ab73d7515-2
01:22:51.291 --> 01:22:54.673
you know,
that just aren't and there's not really,

90be2d1e-251f-4bab-a58f-216ab73d7515-3
01:22:54.673 --> 01:22:59.581
again, kind of as Doctor Sedo said,
I think you have to put some teeth in

90be2d1e-251f-4bab-a58f-216ab73d7515-4
01:22:59.581 --> 01:23:04.290
some of these things to say that if
you're going to do this, you know,

90be2d1e-251f-4bab-a58f-216ab73d7515-5
01:23:04.290 --> 01:23:08.800
you've got to check these boxes or else
that hospital, you know, X.

4f90a6a0-78b9-4c75-9b00-6a2a5b47c8e7-0
01:23:09.200 --> 01:23:12.479
And so, you know, I think it's,
I think that's what one of the things

4f90a6a0-78b9-4c75-9b00-6a2a5b47c8e7-1
01:23:12.479 --> 01:23:16.040
that's important to you if you work in
our hospital that I used to work in.

bd653627-201e-4d9b-b735-ec0e196d4268-0
01:23:16.040 --> 01:23:18.951
And you look at the under table shielding,
you know,

bd653627-201e-4d9b-b735-ec0e196d4268-1
01:23:18.951 --> 01:23:23.290
it was the original shielding of what's
left of it used to go all the way down

bd653627-201e-4d9b-b735-ec0e196d4268-2
01:23:23.290 --> 01:23:23.840
the table.

e5668b57-05f4-4d74-a7fb-6da1359b6e39-0
01:23:23.840 --> 01:23:27.960
And now there's like 3 little strands and,
you know, all torn up.

389e1f4c-66f6-4a9e-a6a1-15a393367da9-0
01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:30.203
And,
and so they hadn't been replaced in the

389e1f4c-66f6-4a9e-a6a1-15a393367da9-1
01:23:30.203 --> 01:23:31.200
abdominal shielding.

b5751f7d-f3f8-4ac8-96a5-d0fbba625ff5-0
01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:32.520
You know, who knows where it is?

1c926313-d0d4-440b-ae87-3292de333cc2-0
01:23:32.840 --> 01:23:35.560
You know, you got lost years ago and,
and nobody ever put it on.

6466b901-b252-4dac-8ed2-05ea2437439a-0
01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:39.525
You have Cath lab changes and personnel
that never knew that there used to be

6466b901-b252-4dac-8ed2-05ea2437439a-1
01:23:39.525 --> 01:23:41.000
abdominal shielding on there.

f32937dc-6723-4749-a496-e9fa15fa3132-0
01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:46.823
But but again, it's, you know, there's no,
there's no forcing education to say,

f32937dc-6723-4749-a496-e9fa15fa3132-1
01:23:46.823 --> 01:23:50.238
you know,
this is what's proper in these labs and

f32937dc-6723-4749-a496-e9fa15fa3132-2
01:23:50.238 --> 01:23:52.559
this is what has to be maintained.

8d3079e9-1bbb-49fd-986b-bb17f8fb953e-0
01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:56.720
And, and maybe it goes back to that,
that kind of time out.

3d30daf6-adb2-46f8-a952-30d330528ca3-0
01:23:57.240 --> 01:23:59.382
But, you know,
do we have everything in the proper

3d30daf6-adb2-46f8-a952-30d330528ca3-1
01:23:59.382 --> 01:23:59.760
position?

1f956ddb-37ac-4666-9521-e92604f248ce-0
01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:01.960
Trainees do have a power.

552a7ad7-f661-4389-be35-7d44a4b99209-0
01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:04.870
So for this is not about radiation
protection,

552a7ad7-f661-4389-be35-7d44a4b99209-1
01:24:04.870 --> 01:24:09.761
but trainees have the power to demand if
some center is not adequate for their

552a7ad7-f661-4389-be35-7d44a4b99209-2
01:24:09.761 --> 01:24:12.299
needs,
they can actually get removed and

552a7ad7-f661-4389-be35-7d44a4b99209-3
01:24:12.299 --> 01:24:13.600
hospitals lose funds.

2995daa3-3c16-4c95-838b-a5422734b47f-0
01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:18.045
If they lose trainees or you lose status
because you do not provide adequate

2995daa3-3c16-4c95-838b-a5422734b47f-1
01:24:18.045 --> 01:24:20.873
teaching,
you don't provide one of them would be

2995daa3-3c16-4c95-838b-a5422734b47f-2
01:24:20.873 --> 01:24:24.280
should be you don't provide adequate
radiation protection.

494803a6-ab99-4a14-b73f-2a7a99a9084b-0
01:24:24.280 --> 01:24:27.858
So why should we send you trainees and
pay for these trainees to be trained by

494803a6-ab99-4a14-b73f-2a7a99a9084b-1
01:24:27.858 --> 01:24:28.040
you?

bf8f69b7-b023-4130-9a94-84b6a4b3bfc3-0
01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:29.800
So trainees have the power.

021a03f7-9553-4efa-b276-867b98715cb3-0
01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:33.199
There's few sites that lost trainees
because of other stuff,

021a03f7-9553-4efa-b276-867b98715cb3-1
01:24:33.199 --> 01:24:37.880
because the trainees spoke to the Deanery
and said this is not we're not having it.

af00852b-e5c3-4a36-9eed-d30836af873d-0
01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:39.360
And therefore trainees didn't go.

e7687c07-fda8-43a9-9d7b-da4e38019c99-0
01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:43.240
And then the hospitals were forced to
make those changes so they can get

e7687c07-fda8-43a9-9d7b-da4e38019c99-1
01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:46.695
trainees back because they lost their
status as a training site,

e7687c07-fda8-43a9-9d7b-da4e38019c99-2
01:24:46.695 --> 01:24:50.682
which is a big deal in the UK for
university teacher hospital and you lose

e7687c07-fda8-43a9-9d7b-da4e38019c99-3
01:24:50.682 --> 01:24:51.320
your status.

48bb9207-13bc-4f75-9512-056f3402edf9-0
01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:53.080
That's a lot of money.

7179c093-12fe-4ecf-a37f-88e235527bbd-0
01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:53.160
Wow.

e4ff9d90-ec1c-4843-9f8b-361da622a330-0
01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:55.280
Yeah, that's teeth.

32f19852-1fb2-4515-bcbf-85402bb4ad29-0
01:24:56.120 --> 01:24:58.920
We don't know,
you know which which that may be.

a6be097a-e54c-44c5-abd1-aa6d087a57c8-0
01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:00.680
You know, again,
that's maybe what it takes.

9cffdf71-fb98-46ab-9c37-64726923e870-0
01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:03.440
Well, that's the end of our time everyone,
thank you.

6d85468c-4247-4298-b65e-d96b5b45776d-0
01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:04.320
It was fantastic.

d3acfafb-73df-4de6-b31e-5cfa1074ff89-0
01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:05.800
Hopefully I'll see some of you tomorrow.

f172e91e-f645-4455-b8d7-0804cc28d8bb-0
01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:07.520
You know that.

608c78f7-87e8-4952-bdc7-240c3e237eed-0
01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:13.113
I think it just winds up a great day of
the first CERT 2025 tomorrow will start

608c78f7-87e8-4952-bdc7-240c3e237eed-1
01:25:13.113 --> 01:25:15.840
tomorrow at 9:00 Eastern for session 5.

2aa6fcaf-bf9e-4322-a158-84d5975482bc-0
01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:19.920
It's I think Bella's going to lead,
lead data protecting women in practice.

9402b18f-afde-4613-b933-e97e1164f569-0
01:25:19.920 --> 01:25:23.040
So looking forward to that and then
