00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.640
Hello, My name is Audra Kocher.

b401e848-ce96-4a65-bb1c-897be418fd93-0
00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:05.037
I'm an interventional cardiologist at the
Brigham and Women's Hospital and we're at

b401e848-ce96-4a65-bb1c-897be418fd93-1
00:00:05.037 --> 00:00:07.950
the privilege of serving as the program
director for the Interventional

b401e848-ce96-4a65-bb1c-897be418fd93-2
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:08.840
Cardiology Fellowship.

8f069be0-0aba-45b3-9d82-9a63e2099368-0
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.211
And in this role,
I became very interested in how to

8f069be0-0aba-45b3-9d82-9a63e2099368-1
00:00:13.211 --> 00:00:18.299
optimize well-being and minimize
potential injuries for our trainees,

8f069be0-0aba-45b3-9d82-9a63e2099368-2
00:00:18.299 --> 00:00:24.258
which has led me to help lead A-Team here
at the Brigham to conduct a prospective

8f069be0-0aba-45b3-9d82-9a63e2099368-3
00:00:24.258 --> 00:00:28.765
study called Ergo Cath,
which we feel very passionately about

8f069be0-0aba-45b3-9d82-9a63e2099368-4
00:00:28.765 --> 00:00:30.800
sharing with everyone today.

8bdbb8e5-e566-4bc8-8b8c-1548b1ce93c2-0
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.160
So the title of my talk today is what the
data tell us,

8bdbb8e5-e566-4bc8-8b8c-1548b1ce93c2-1
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.040
ergonomic and orthopedic risks in the
Cath lab.

d29a6fb3-3848-434b-acff-1264a36b99ac-0
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.402
These are my disclosures,
the most pertinent of which is in order

d29a6fb3-3848-434b-acff-1264a36b99ac-1
00:00:42.402 --> 00:00:46.774
to fund the Ergo Cath study,
we did apply and obtain a research grant

d29a6fb3-3848-434b-acff-1264a36b99ac-2
00:00:46.774 --> 00:00:48.960
from our colleagues at Rampart Inc.

45cbc3bd-2d62-4948-bfc2-02f55ff34bd3-0
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.560
So let's set the stage with a background.

20c87833-55bf-4ece-bccd-dd18f5630fe4-0
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.320
I'm personally an interventional
cardiologist and,

20c87833-55bf-4ece-bccd-dd18f5630fe4-1
00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.204
and and thus have to give a lot of credit
to my colleagues at Sky who advocate for

20c87833-55bf-4ece-bccd-dd18f5630fe4-2
00:01:02.204 --> 00:01:06.734
our community and in their advocacy have
done now serial surveys about every

20c87833-55bf-4ece-bccd-dd18f5630fe4-3
00:01:06.734 --> 00:01:10.029
decade or so,
The most recent of which was conducted in

20c87833-55bf-4ece-bccd-dd18f5630fe4-4
00:01:10.029 --> 00:01:13.677
2023, published last year,
really looking at the occupational

20c87833-55bf-4ece-bccd-dd18f5630fe4-5
00:01:13.677 --> 00:01:16.560
hazards of being an interventional
cardiologist.

fef3a7e5-ea9a-4ae9-8b39-c79c43ebd3c2-0
00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.160
And the most recent survey really
highlights some very important findings.

e863a420-6f4c-4df1-823c-3b5b757024e2-0
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.600
The first of which is that 60%,
let me repeat that number again.

12756dbc-e92b-4eeb-a00c-83461a34302f-0
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.740
60% of respondents had at least one
orthopedic injury with a third of

12756dbc-e92b-4eeb-a00c-83461a34302f-1
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.480
respondents stating that they had
experienced lumbar spinal injuries.

3984f823-aa79-4394-9ea8-84c3048485bc-0
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.049
20% of respondents were forced to limit
their time in the Cath lab with the

3984f823-aa79-4394-9ea8-84c3048485bc-1
00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:45.635
obvious downstream economic ramifications
to to those local Cath lab environments

3984f823-aa79-4394-9ea8-84c3048485bc-2
00:01:45.635 --> 00:01:49.940
and obviously the negative impact on
patients who required care and would to

3984f823-aa79-4394-9ea8-84c3048485bc-3
00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.240
be able to get it from those
interventional cardiologists.

2e9f3198-1ced-4473-b026-e3a9e5181bd5-0
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.445
Moreover,
there was a threefold higher risk of

2e9f3198-1ced-4473-b026-e3a9e5181bd5-1
00:01:56.445 --> 00:02:00.744
radiation related pathology to
interventional cardiologists as compared

2e9f3198-1ced-4473-b026-e3a9e5181bd5-2
00:02:00.744 --> 00:02:04.804
with the general population,
including factors such as malignancies

2e9f3198-1ced-4473-b026-e3a9e5181bd5-3
00:02:04.804 --> 00:02:05.640
and cataracts.

1f391367-f67e-405c-bb58-da1f5494cbd4-0
00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.303
And so based on these rather sobering
data,

1f391367-f67e-405c-bb58-da1f5494cbd4-1
00:02:09.303 --> 00:02:13.479
our team at the Brigham became really
interested in the question,

1f391367-f67e-405c-bb58-da1f5494cbd4-2
00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:18.794
which was sort of what are the underlying
mechanisms that drive such a high risk of

1f391367-f67e-405c-bb58-da1f5494cbd4-3
00:02:18.794 --> 00:02:23.160
orthopedic injury in particular and and
what research has been done.

705c14e9-dcb9-4446-95e1-63ba525fa84a-0
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.195
And when we delved into the literature,
we realized that there really were a

705c14e9-dcb9-4446-95e1-63ba525fa84a-1
00:02:28.195 --> 00:02:33.558
dearth of studies that were examining the
underlying mechanisms that were driving

705c14e9-dcb9-4446-95e1-63ba525fa84a-2
00:02:33.558 --> 00:02:35.520
this very high rate of injury.

1983b9db-7258-4fe8-8433-53ceff8209eb-0
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.396
Importantly,
these injuries were occurring despite,

1983b9db-7258-4fe8-8433-53ceff8209eb-1
00:02:39.396 --> 00:02:43.996
despite the fact that many interventional
cardiologists were engaging in

1983b9db-7258-4fe8-8433-53ceff8209eb-2
00:02:43.996 --> 00:02:45.320
preventative efforts.

0169aa6c-1d5a-46e3-a693-c8f41e53f177-0
00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.219
In fact,
over 80% of respondents were engaged in

0169aa6c-1d5a-46e3-a693-c8f41e53f177-1
00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:52.420
some kind of preventative efforts,
whether that was strength training,

0169aa6c-1d5a-46e3-a693-c8f41e53f177-2
00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.036
stretching or yoga and other exercises
such as aerobic activities and Pilates

0169aa6c-1d5a-46e3-a693-c8f41e53f177-3
00:02:57.036 --> 00:02:59.994
and, and,
and this sort of background really sort

0169aa6c-1d5a-46e3-a693-c8f41e53f177-4
00:02:59.994 --> 00:03:02.480
of drove us to design the Ergo Cath study.

e4b50f28-d17d-4815-82e9-2c3881153846-0
00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.184
Ergo Cath was a single center prospective
study with the primary goal of

e4b50f28-d17d-4815-82e9-2c3881153846-1
00:03:08.184 --> 00:03:12.560
quantifying the ergonomic strain on Cath
lab operators.

a18312e5-40d9-4f4c-90db-455d4162fc19-0
00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.480
And specifically we wanted to condition
this on two key situations.

28309624-bed1-4ceb-b73f-c1c78dec1b4e-0
00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.813
The first was sort of standard
traditional Cath lab practice wearing

28309624-bed1-4ceb-b73f-c1c78dec1b4e-1
00:03:23.813 --> 00:03:28.760
lead shielding usually at our lab will
wear a vest and a skirt.

7aa09b7c-424a-4748-8d30-effc998a54b4-0
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.701
But then the second condition was to
assess these ergonomic strain patterns in

7aa09b7c-424a-4748-8d30-effc998a54b4-1
00:03:34.701 --> 00:03:38.431
a lead free environment using the novel
Rampart device,

7aa09b7c-424a-4748-8d30-effc998a54b4-2
00:03:38.431 --> 00:03:43.160
which allowed us to literally shed our
lead and to proceed from there.

a176e8b1-842f-4427-93ee-2b4bbd279ca2-0
00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.480
So for this study,
we recruited 20 Cath lab operators.

5d427832-f728-45d1-97e4-243393dfce2e-0
00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.072
This included attending cardiologists,
fellows,

5d427832-f728-45d1-97e4-243393dfce2e-1
00:03:49.072 --> 00:03:51.720
both general fellows and interventional
fellows.

bb95e74d-9df0-4a1e-9db3-32cae7d2e1f7-0
00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.375
And then we had a cadre of wonderful
physician assistants who work with us as

bb95e74d-9df0-4a1e-9db3-32cae7d2e1f7-1
00:03:55.375 --> 00:03:55.600
well.

682a8773-b3ac-4ad4-bf89-46bea877825c-0
00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:02.253
Additionally, as a pre specified analysis,
we had a cohort of both nurses and

682a8773-b3ac-4ad4-bf89-46bea877825c-1
00:04:02.253 --> 00:04:05.400
technicians whom we studied at our lab.

ac257344-098a-4abc-9403-bbd91a81f45b-0
00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.620
Even if the Rampart device is being
employed,

ac257344-098a-4abc-9403-bbd91a81f45b-1
00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.783
the nurses and techs both will still wear
lead and so we only studied them in that

ac257344-098a-4abc-9403-bbd91a81f45b-2
00:04:13.783 --> 00:04:15.960
sort of traditional lead condition.

55a73760-0a39-40da-a25d-2147abff9cee-0
00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.400
So how did we measure the ergonomic
strain?

d9736535-d929-4402-8897-c4a2b7f5ba9a-0
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.939
Well,
we used multiple different measurement

d9736535-d929-4402-8897-c4a2b7f5ba9a-1
00:04:22.939 --> 00:04:26.888
modalities to understand different
dimensions of ergonomic strain and

d9736535-d929-4402-8897-c4a2b7f5ba9a-2
00:04:26.888 --> 00:04:28.920
potential risk to orthopedic injury.

e4e0fc07-11fa-4f4e-976b-fa95087b6236-0
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.964
First,
we employed inertial monitoring units or

e4e0fc07-11fa-4f4e-976b-fa95087b6236-1
00:04:32.964 --> 00:04:33.520
I am use.

81b14690-3296-4678-b809-3131467cbdb1-0
00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:39.397
These allow us to capture live kinematic
data and to quantify the amount,

81b14690-3296-4678-b809-3131467cbdb1-1
00:04:39.397 --> 00:04:44.320
amount of time that a particular joint is
in a high risk position.

9a5e6d8e-984d-4cd8-a06a-587127658676-0
00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.200
And so let me focus your eyes right here.

0a16aa0f-25c7-495d-9b65-51d1b5be5ff2-0
00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:51.331
This is an IMU center at this sort of
C7C8 level and it will allow us to

0a16aa0f-25c7-495d-9b65-51d1b5be5ff2-1
00:04:51.331 --> 00:04:56.533
quantify the percent of time that this
operator is in a high risk flex or

0a16aa0f-25c7-495d-9b65-51d1b5be5ff2-2
00:04:56.533 --> 00:05:00.400
extended position as opposed to in a
neutral position.

b0dd83e9-e85b-4b47-810f-736926658642-0
00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.680
Next, we use surface EM GS,
which you see right here.

3aecfdaf-1668-436c-a597-8497d0457970-0
00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.480
So the surface EM GS allow us to quantify
muscle activation,

3aecfdaf-1668-436c-a597-8497d0457970-1
00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:14.037
peak muscle activation levels and then
some sort of mean muscle activation

3aecfdaf-1668-436c-a597-8497d0457970-2
00:05:14.037 --> 00:05:20.040
levels as well to get a sense of concepts
of muscle fatigue and and we know that

3aecfdaf-1668-436c-a597-8497d0457970-3
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:25.746
muscle fatigue can then be associated
with soft tissue injury and downstream

3aecfdaf-1668-436c-a597-8497d0457970-4
00:05:25.746 --> 00:05:27.080
orthopedic injury.

333686da-a9d7-462e-b358-8548d68dd5f8-0
00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:34.412
We used a validated musculoskeletal
injury survey to try to quantify the

333686da-a9d7-462e-b358-8548d68dd5f8-1
00:05:34.412 --> 00:05:40.960
amount of discomfort that operators were
were facing with these cases.

e479215e-9cbe-41af-b0d2-c0ca7faa66ce-0
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:46.460
And then we used a real time radiation
dose monitoring system to understand the

e479215e-9cbe-41af-b0d2-c0ca7faa66ce-1
00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:51.520
amount of radiation that operators were
being exposed to in the two conditions.

46d3549f-7ccb-4535-a362-c5fd3c277d33-0
00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.343
Again,
this sort of traditional LED vest and

46d3549f-7ccb-4535-a362-c5fd3c277d33-1
00:05:54.343 --> 00:05:57.480
skirt versus using the more novel Rampart
system.

a1173bdb-5758-416e-a73b-6b3bcba6a55e-0
00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:02.836
The primary endpoint for this analysis
was a percent of time that was in a high

a1173bdb-5758-416e-a73b-6b3bcba6a55e-1
00:06:02.836 --> 00:06:08.144
risk position and I've alluded to sort of
some of the pre specified endpoints that

a1173bdb-5758-416e-a73b-6b3bcba6a55e-2
00:06:08.144 --> 00:06:09.359
we have alluded to.

136cc7b5-bf54-446b-806d-05917b4f7daf-0
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.160
This is a graphical depiction of the data
that we were seeing.

e3a5f122-b020-4e57-b5ad-c07cda7223fc-0
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:19.496
You can see here is one of our fellows
leaning over as we're removing an

e3a5f122-b020-4e57-b5ad-c07cda7223fc-1
00:06:19.496 --> 00:06:21.240
impellus peel away sheath.

424bc5ff-ab30-46b5-a905-46ab611f5db7-0
00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:27.037
And you can see in a pictorial
representation of his spine in in what

424bc5ff-ab30-46b5-a905-46ab611f5db7-1
00:06:27.037 --> 00:06:33.745
extreme angles he's had to contort his
spine in order to do a relatively routine

424bc5ff-ab30-46b5-a905-46ab611f5db7-2
00:06:33.745 --> 00:06:34.160
task.

fd2d1c15-e4b5-41e3-b93d-4f0d7e59061e-0
00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.605
And you can imagine then how high the
strains are,

fd2d1c15-e4b5-41e3-b93d-4f0d7e59061e-1
00:06:39.605 --> 00:06:45.938
especially cumulatively if we're exposing
ourselves to these high strains day after

fd2d1c15-e4b5-41e3-b93d-4f0d7e59061e-2
00:06:45.938 --> 00:06:46.240
day.

adfd1d0e-09a2-48f9-b5b9-f97c0823ed2c-0
00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.324
For anyone who is not familiar with the
Rampart system,

adfd1d0e-09a2-48f9-b5b9-f97c0823ed2c-1
00:06:51.324 --> 00:06:55.856
it's a interlocking business,
acrylic motorized panels that essentially

adfd1d0e-09a2-48f9-b5b9-f97c0823ed2c-2
00:06:55.856 --> 00:07:00.200
allows physicians to and technicians
potentially to get out of lead.

74887bf2-d478-48e8-94c8-e25caf7f9055-0
00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.600
It slides over the patient.

fbbdbb3b-e666-4e12-9b5c-53b3ea745602-0
00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.944
And we can talk more about this later,
but I really would love to delve into the

fbbdbb3b-e666-4e12-9b5c-53b3ea745602-1
00:07:05.944 --> 00:07:06.200
data.

7eb968ee-b078-4229-ae30-2910abb22f9d-0
00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.520
So these are the primary findings of the
Ergo Cath study.

0c57b0fe-92a7-4682-ae28-b3ba65b657b5-0
00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:15.411
Just to provide a little bit of context,
the mean age is around 4140% of

0c57b0fe-92a7-4682-ae28-b3ba65b657b5-1
00:07:15.411 --> 00:07:17.320
participants were female.

6fabd959-fe64-4fd0-96c1-8a41aa6ba8ca-0
00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:20.360
There was good distribution between
attendings and interventional fellows.

1c492dfd-8098-4754-bb25-88c7981e86fd-0
00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:23.443
In particular,
the highest percent of cases were

1c492dfd-8098-4754-bb25-88c7981e86fd-1
00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:25.080
diagnostic coronary cases.

b586fbb0-08da-4197-b4a8-d86b3ccdebe0-0
00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:28.992
There's a fair amount of PCI that were
captured in ergo Cath as well as some

b586fbb0-08da-4197-b4a8-d86b3ccdebe0-1
00:07:28.992 --> 00:07:32.560
structural and other cases such as
pericardial synthesis and radar caths.

7fce7ef4-70db-4e01-8009-0cf2c95c4cff-0
00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:37.520
This is the most important slide of this
talk.

68c3ef27-db35-4968-881a-bec5584bb6f5-0
00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:42.921
So if you haven't been paying attention
till now, I'd sort of focus on this one,

68c3ef27-db35-4968-881a-bec5584bb6f5-1
00:07:42.921 --> 00:07:47.527
which demonstrated for the primary
endpoint that at the cervical joint in

68c3ef27-db35-4968-881a-bec5584bb6f5-2
00:07:47.527 --> 00:07:52.008
the axial rotation dimension,
it was in a high risk position for 34% of

68c3ef27-db35-4968-881a-bec5584bb6f5-3
00:07:52.008 --> 00:07:52.880
case duration.

079955ff-1969-4c7f-a30c-1bfcd36ba212-0
00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:59.269
That is a soberingly high number for us
to be putting our C spine in such a high

079955ff-1969-4c7f-a30c-1bfcd36ba212-1
00:07:59.269 --> 00:08:01.320
risk position for so long.

c946a69b-74cc-41ef-aca4-02d304fa467e-0
00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:06.862
Case to case, perhaps not unsurprisingly,
as the picture that I showed before

c946a69b-74cc-41ef-aca4-02d304fa467e-1
00:08:06.862 --> 00:08:10.596
really revealed,
is that fellows or P As were placed in a

c946a69b-74cc-41ef-aca4-02d304fa467e-2
00:08:10.596 --> 00:08:14.073
higher risk position more frequently than
attendings,

c946a69b-74cc-41ef-aca4-02d304fa467e-3
00:08:14.073 --> 00:08:19.160
most prominently again in the cervical
spine in that axial rotation dimension.

e8184286-6dcc-4249-a6ee-187b0a846b7e-0
00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:23.304
Moreover,
our nurses and techs were in high risk

e8184286-6dcc-4249-a6ee-187b0a846b7e-1
00:08:23.304 --> 00:08:26.204
positions even more than we as operators
were,

e8184286-6dcc-4249-a6ee-187b0a846b7e-2
00:08:26.204 --> 00:08:28.920
particularly in the torso pelvic
dimension.

9cab9d51-6d02-4ca6-9995-a898a9c1e8eb-0
00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:34.120
So pretty similar in the cervical,
axial and cervical flexion dimensions.

bcc38ddc-251d-44f8-a3e5-010e4d98c925-0
00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:37.092
But if,
if I focus your eyes to the torso pelvic

bcc38ddc-251d-44f8-a3e5-010e4d98c925-1
00:08:37.092 --> 00:08:39.701
flexion area,
our nurses and techs were in

bcc38ddc-251d-44f8-a3e5-010e4d98c925-2
00:08:39.701 --> 00:08:44.008
significantly higher frequency of being
in a high risk position there,

bcc38ddc-251d-44f8-a3e5-010e4d98c925-3
00:08:44.008 --> 00:08:48.012
which I think is based on the different
tasks that they're doing,

bcc38ddc-251d-44f8-a3e5-010e4d98c925-4
00:08:48.012 --> 00:08:51.834
sort of bending down to, to,
to pick a stent or leading up to,

bcc38ddc-251d-44f8-a3e5-010e4d98c925-5
00:08:51.834 --> 00:08:54.200
to grab certain equipment and so forth.

d13512b2-8898-4cbb-8a70-9f01fe408ac6-0
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:58.120
Now, why do we care about it,
especially at the cervical C spine level?

4d769025-552f-4026-b136-c1ec6164fcdc-0
00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.519
Well,
we know extrapolating from prior

4d769025-552f-4026-b136-c1ec6164fcdc-1
00:09:00.519 --> 00:09:05.194
ergonomic and orthopedic data that even
very modest deviations from neutral

4d769025-552f-4026-b136-c1ec6164fcdc-2
00:09:05.194 --> 00:09:08.640
position can result in drastically higher
spinal loads.

caa498fd-cfb4-402c-8b4a-6b3165fadec0-0
00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:12.733
So if I focus your eyes here to sort of a
neutral position,

caa498fd-cfb4-402c-8b4a-6b3165fadec0-1
00:09:12.733 --> 00:09:17.471
just set sort of standing neutrally,
the force to the C spine is about 5

caa498fd-cfb4-402c-8b4a-6b3165fadec0-2
00:09:17.471 --> 00:09:18.120
kilograms.

f7dcbcf0-bb9b-4e1e-aa8f-6ed9d37fda8a-0
00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:23.440
Even only a modest deviation, about 30%,
will increase the force to C spine to 18

f7dcbcf0-bb9b-4e1e-aa8f-6ed9d37fda8a-1
00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.920
kilograms to more than three fold higher.

119d269d-0059-4072-8971-fb55dcbc3f9e-0
00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:29.759
And so again,
the concern is not just the individual

119d269d-0059-4072-8971-fb55dcbc3f9e-1
00:09:29.759 --> 00:09:32.408
case,
but the cumulative impact of day after

119d269d-0059-4072-8971-fb55dcbc3f9e-2
00:09:32.408 --> 00:09:36.999
day, month after month, year after year,
that turns into decade after decade.

259881dd-c75d-443d-986b-a71351750041-0
00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.200
What about the surface EMG data?

1e537c9f-9fd6-4b14-8afd-90217a3759b1-0
00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.640
Well,
this showed some pretty interesting data.

727a26a5-fdf6-45ed-9a74-5759a050cfa2-0
00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:45.240
Let me first provide a little bit of
context.

f28cb27a-f37b-47b9-819c-555875a2036e-0
00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:51.097
The surface EMG data is calculated as a
percentage of an NVC or maximal voluntary

f28cb27a-f37b-47b9-819c-555875a2036e-1
00:09:51.097 --> 00:09:51.920
contraction.

c31e04d2-2601-4d60-b5aa-25733049030f-0
00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:55.640
So that is done before we have even
started to measure any data.

efe73cac-61f8-4621-b66a-856453757784-0
00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:59.392
You, you,
you calculate an MVC and then all these

efe73cac-61f8-4621-b66a-856453757784-1
00:09:59.392 --> 00:10:02.560
values that you have here are a percent
of that.

4bb8e97c-9bed-4659-85d9-6887c4e2684e-0
00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:07.514
We know from prior literature that a
surface EMG values of 15 certainly 20%

4bb8e97c-9bed-4659-85d9-6887c4e2684e-1
00:10:07.514 --> 00:10:11.400
correlate with a higher risk for muscle
fatigue and micro trauma.

78b4d113-14ff-49df-b4a7-6f5ddcc6c2c3-0
00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:18.621
And so if we look in the lead leaded
condition at the mean cervical EMG value

78b4d113-14ff-49df-b4a7-6f5ddcc6c2c3-1
00:10:18.621 --> 00:10:22.160
is 21 percent and the peak was over 250.

085d230d-843f-4635-909f-49c465d1892f-0
00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:27.205
And if we look in the in the comparator
group in the rampart arm that we can see

085d230d-843f-4635-909f-49c465d1892f-1
00:10:27.205 --> 00:10:31.640
that there is a considerable reduction in
both the mean and the peak value.

08da8cb8-e89c-4864-a069-6ef5966c213e-0
00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:38.516
And similarly if we look at the lumbar
power spinal muscles that the mean value

08da8cb8-e89c-4864-a069-6ef5966c213e-1
00:10:38.516 --> 00:10:42.040
there is 18, so above that 15% threshold.

dc558dfe-8a4f-43d4-9611-c4d301f2cfbb-0
00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:48.342
And again if we look at the intervention
arm that there is a reduction in

dc558dfe-8a4f-43d4-9611-c4d301f2cfbb-1
00:10:48.342 --> 00:10:53.030
basically all the surface EMG parameters
in the mean value,

dc558dfe-8a4f-43d4-9611-c4d301f2cfbb-2
00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:58.266
peak and variability values,
suggesting that using a sort of novel

dc558dfe-8a4f-43d4-9611-c4d301f2cfbb-3
00:10:58.266 --> 00:11:02.251
leadless system may help reduce muscle
activation,

dc558dfe-8a4f-43d4-9611-c4d301f2cfbb-4
00:11:02.251 --> 00:11:06.080
muscle fatigue and potentially then micro
drama.

2cd8f4a1-70ca-424e-88bc-b088353a1f8a-0
00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:12.200
Looking at the data from our real time
radiation monitoring,

2cd8f4a1-70ca-424e-88bc-b088353a1f8a-1
00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:17.150
we see that there was a fivefold
reduction in radiation exposure to

2cd8f4a1-70ca-424e-88bc-b088353a1f8a-2
00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:22.319
operators using the Rampart system as
compared with a traditional lead

2cd8f4a1-70ca-424e-88bc-b088353a1f8a-3
00:11:22.319 --> 00:11:23.120
protection.

e6c82b3a-73db-450a-abdc-5c29ae7b25f9-0
00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:26.640
So what can we do about this?

c8de2d43-7bc6-4ad5-9007-b69807395ca4-0
00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:29.856
Well,
there is a trial that was published out

c8de2d43-7bc6-4ad5-9007-b69807395ca4-1
00:11:29.856 --> 00:11:35.450
of the Mayo Clinic called the STRETCH
trial that included a a relatively simple

c8de2d43-7bc6-4ad5-9007-b69807395ca4-2
00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:36.359
intervention.

53411d92-b594-46a4-a583-69d89aa40a36-0
00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:40.053
It was a 15 minute daily stretching
program that was designed in

53411d92-b594-46a4-a583-69d89aa40a36-1
00:11:40.053 --> 00:11:44.428
collaboration with a physical therapist
and focused on a number of different

53411d92-b594-46a4-a583-69d89aa40a36-2
00:11:44.428 --> 00:11:48.520
aspects, the neck, upper extremities,
lower back and lower extremities.

25f493c5-be95-4c1f-bd49-c6eac59bb0f2-0
00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.880
And even this was done over a year.

53f6bd8e-2c06-44b3-8fb1-e7d501a94037-0
00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:56.742
The average amount of time that people
actually engaged in this was only 120

53f6bd8e-2c06-44b3-8fb1-e7d501a94037-1
00:11:56.742 --> 00:11:57.040
days.

1f825948-7816-4ade-8217-7d2a76f73de6-0
00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:00.368
But even with a relatively low engagement
rate,

1f825948-7816-4ade-8217-7d2a76f73de6-1
00:12:00.368 --> 00:12:05.386
there was a statistically significant
reduction in both neck and arm related

1f825948-7816-4ade-8217-7d2a76f73de6-2
00:12:05.386 --> 00:12:08.514
pain,
suggesting that this is an important part

1f825948-7816-4ade-8217-7d2a76f73de6-3
00:12:08.514 --> 00:12:12.360
of what we should be incorporating in our
daily practices.

159af3c0-a7b0-4218-9795-761ca6e8d1cd-0
00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:16.866
Furthermore,
and this is a image of what the different

159af3c0-a7b0-4218-9795-761ca6e8d1cd-1
00:12:16.866 --> 00:12:19.200
exercises were over that 15 minute.

f644f8c2-4c8c-46fa-bfe0-b5b53b15ec90-0
00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:23.030
Furthermore,
looking at the surgical literature,

f644f8c2-4c8c-46fa-bfe0-b5b53b15ec90-1
00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:27.302
there is a fair amount of data that
suggests that using micro breaks,

f644f8c2-4c8c-46fa-bfe0-b5b53b15ec90-2
00:12:27.302 --> 00:12:30.720
especially during long cases,
may be very advantageous.

924487d1-9bcf-45fb-bfbb-9718e6adc0d6-0
00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:36.052
So even one to two-minute deliberate
interventions every 40 or so minutes

924487d1-9bcf-45fb-bfbb-9718e6adc0d6-1
00:12:36.052 --> 00:12:41.435
involving rotational movements and
activation of different muscle groups did

924487d1-9bcf-45fb-bfbb-9718e6adc0d6-2
00:12:41.435 --> 00:12:46.188
not increase case duration,
but did result in improved mental focus

924487d1-9bcf-45fb-bfbb-9718e6adc0d6-3
00:12:46.188 --> 00:12:51.920
and also considerably higher association
with improvement in physical performance

924487d1-9bcf-45fb-bfbb-9718e6adc0d6-4
00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:52.480
as well.

c7553dea-4d42-4a57-8132-90fc0fb28bde-0
00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:58.912
I think we are in a very exciting time in
interventional cardiology and this should

c7553dea-4d42-4a57-8132-90fc0fb28bde-1
00:12:58.912 --> 00:13:03.245
extend to other areas of medicine such as
interventional radiology,

c7553dea-4d42-4a57-8132-90fc0fb28bde-2
00:13:03.245 --> 00:13:08.087
GI vascular surgery in which there
finally are multiple different potential

c7553dea-4d42-4a57-8132-90fc0fb28bde-3
00:13:08.087 --> 00:13:12.739
solutions to the joint issues of
radiation related injury and orthopedic

c7553dea-4d42-4a57-8132-90fc0fb28bde-4
00:13:12.739 --> 00:13:17.709
related harm that is magnified as a
result of wearing sort of have you LED in

c7553dea-4d42-4a57-8132-90fc0fb28bde-5
00:13:17.709 --> 00:13:23.125
that sky survey that I alluded to earlier,
the primary barrier to adoption and novel

c7553dea-4d42-4a57-8132-90fc0fb28bde-6
00:13:23.125 --> 00:13:26.120
strategies was cost and administrative
hurdle.

00c0e7cf-276d-4ab1-84d7-e907801ba1d4-0
00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:29.046
And I would say that as a clinical
community,

00c0e7cf-276d-4ab1-84d7-e907801ba1d4-1
00:13:29.046 --> 00:13:33.181
it is essential that we advocate for this,
not just for ourself,

00c0e7cf-276d-4ab1-84d7-e907801ba1d4-2
00:13:33.181 --> 00:13:36.680
but if for no other reason than just
economics, right?

e3dae73b-ba52-4742-b3ca-c6b7a2b6a427-0
00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:41.418
Reducing the amount of time that
individuals are out of the Cath lab are

e3dae73b-ba52-4742-b3ca-c6b7a2b6a427-1
00:13:41.418 --> 00:13:45.793
allowing for greater efficiency and less
discomfort and allowing for, for,

e3dae73b-ba52-4742-b3ca-c6b7a2b6a427-2
00:13:45.793 --> 00:13:48.360
for better and I think higher quality
care.

b6e41541-1f04-4120-97da-ce36b542cbcb-0
00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:50.720
So lots of different potential solutions.

7f82b2e6-8967-4050-aef6-af4ae49afe42-0
00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:55.727
And I think it's important that we start
adopting these in a thoughtful but very

7f82b2e6-8967-4050-aef6-af4ae49afe42-1
00:13:55.727 --> 00:13:56.840
deliberate manner.

e15fdef8-f475-4735-867b-677b6facb81c-0
00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:00.619
All right,
Final take home points is that 60% of

e15fdef8-f475-4735-867b-677b6facb81c-1
00:14:00.619 --> 00:14:05.531
interventional cardiologists suffer from
some orthopedic injury with a third of of

e15fdef8-f475-4735-867b-677b6facb81c-2
00:14:05.531 --> 00:14:07.840
those suffering lumbar spinal injuries.

189d6135-474b-46c3-931f-3e40cf2aa4f8-0
00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:11.168
And this leads to considerable downstream
economic issues,

189d6135-474b-46c3-931f-3e40cf2aa4f8-1
00:14:11.168 --> 00:14:15.512
challenges with recruitment to our field
and and certainly most importantly,

189d6135-474b-46c3-931f-3e40cf2aa4f8-2
00:14:15.512 --> 00:14:17.599
potential patient care ramifications.

ab9e69f6-95bc-410a-9295-52f1c4dc1651-0
00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:22.608
We designed the Ergocath study that
showed that amongst Cath lab operators,

ab9e69f6-95bc-410a-9295-52f1c4dc1651-1
00:14:22.608 --> 00:14:26.920
the cervical joint was in a high risk
position for 34% of case duration.

2b58bec2-0f45-4267-b4c2-84c16d1a295d-0
00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:32.208
There are several solutions included
including rather dedicated daily

2b58bec2-0f45-4267-b4c2-84c16d1a295d-1
00:14:32.208 --> 00:14:37.772
stretching program and one to two-minute
micro break interventions that markedly

2b58bec2-0f45-4267-b4c2-84c16d1a295d-2
00:14:37.772 --> 00:14:43.267
reduce self reported discomfort and novel
leadless or or minimal lead solutions

2b58bec2-0f45-4267-b4c2-84c16d1a295d-3
00:14:43.267 --> 00:14:48.487
coupled with these tailored exercise
regimens may finally allow us to start

2b58bec2-0f45-4267-b4c2-84c16d1a295d-4
00:14:48.487 --> 00:14:53.776
bending the endemic or pandemic of
orthopedic and radiation related injuries

2b58bec2-0f45-4267-b4c2-84c16d1a295d-5
00:14:53.776 --> 00:14:54.119
down.

0fa7c98e-5246-4b9e-9671-446df8fe00de-0
00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:57.688
With that,
I will say thank you so much for your

0fa7c98e-5246-4b9e-9671-446df8fe00de-1
00:14:57.688 --> 00:14:58.000
time.

30e3cf3f-a08f-4f5c-878e-4f791e1b527a-0
00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:03.480
Happy to take any questions on Twitter
and by e-mail as well.

48c02414-1fe2-4239-9c02-5dbf3aa67037-0
00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:04.160
Thank you so much.

69a331dd-3aed-4ec7-bb53-1a8cd4cb0676-0
00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:04.440
Bye.

1a2985d9-84e9-43d8-8ee7-f60261265519-0
00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:13.969
Exercise to reduce and prevent injury and
fatigue and interventional radiology,

1a2985d9-84e9-43d8-8ee7-f60261265519-1
00:15:13.969 --> 00:15:15.640
the whys and the house.

f70c06f7-22a2-4d3f-85bc-77b051276630-0
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.080
So these are my disclosures.

913444ad-2c8b-4115-bfd6-ddd5969dbe26-0
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:31.110
So why should we as interventional
radiologists exercise?

bbaef5aa-2be9-4609-8fb7-8cde39571363-0
00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:37.310
So this is what we know from the
literature.

67d6624b-8204-4bf3-b9f5-9543f43df231-0
00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:42.962
There is a connection between physical
fatigue and mental performance,

67d6624b-8204-4bf3-b9f5-9543f43df231-1
00:15:42.962 --> 00:15:47.612
indicating that physical exhaustion can
impair cognitive functions such as

67d6624b-8204-4bf3-b9f5-9543f43df231-2
00:15:47.612 --> 00:15:50.960
executive functions,
auditory and visional attention,

67d6624b-8204-4bf3-b9f5-9543f43df231-3
00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:52.200
and decision making.

bb7f33f2-36b6-4f65-b607-3a55ee038493-0
00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:58.179
Mental fatigue can lead to
musculoskeletal discomfort and decreased

bb7f33f2-36b6-4f65-b607-3a55ee038493-1
00:15:58.179 --> 00:16:02.094
performance,
and there is also scientific evidence

bb7f33f2-36b6-4f65-b607-3a55ee038493-2
00:16:02.094 --> 00:16:07.160
supporting that physical training for
chronic pain and reduction.

8a2238fe-1898-4697-a787-939db7eafbf0-0
00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:12.214
Furthermore,
posture can influence musculoskeletal

8a2238fe-1898-4697-a787-939db7eafbf0-1
00:16:12.214 --> 00:16:14.200
health and mental performance.

2c66687e-0288-41fb-bb37-db974262a0cd-0
00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:23.779
As interventional radiologists very often
exposed to long procedures with static

2c66687e-0288-41fb-bb37-db974262a0cd-1
00:16:23.779 --> 00:16:24.360
positions.

7073486c-65b5-403c-aed2-8d0490938992-0
00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:29.240
We also wear radiation protective
clothing, sometimes heavy and warm.

88fe8c36-8f55-477c-8c6b-dfce9ba2f54a-0
00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:33.407
These things combined act as a stressor
on the body,

88fe8c36-8f55-477c-8c6b-dfce9ba2f54a-1
00:16:33.407 --> 00:16:36.840
which can induce both mental and physical
fatigue.

200ff407-3c38-48a7-a69a-6c7b02779c33-0
00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:46.011
We know that prolonged physical stress
can lead to muscular fatigue and

200ff407-3c38-48a7-a69a-6c7b02779c33-1
00:16:46.011 --> 00:16:49.126
discomfort,
which in turn activates the stress

200ff407-3c38-48a7-a69a-6c7b02779c33-2
00:16:49.126 --> 00:16:52.904
response system,
leading to elevated cortisol levels and

200ff407-3c38-48a7-a69a-6c7b02779c33-3
00:16:52.904 --> 00:16:54.760
neurotransmitter imbalances.

272049e9-e254-467e-a456-b60c5738a417-0
00:16:55.760 --> 00:17:01.616
This can appear cognitive functions and
cause mental fatigue which in turn can

272049e9-e254-467e-a456-b60c5738a417-1
00:17:01.616 --> 00:17:04.360
cause mental muscle fatigue and pain.

1a8fc640-329c-4fb9-bcbd-4d2aa09d8c88-0
00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:08.960
This leads to a vicious circle of
physical and mental discomfort.

cbd25c59-3ba3-46ea-af94-698a1af83712-0
00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:17.143
Physical exercise can promote the
expression of brain derived neurotropic

cbd25c59-3ba3-46ea-af94-698a1af83712-1
00:17:17.143 --> 00:17:21.886
factor that supports neural health and
plasticity and can also lead to an

cbd25c59-3ba3-46ea-af94-698a1af83712-2
00:17:21.886 --> 00:17:27.078
increase in the release of dopamine and
serotonin which in turn enhance mood and

cbd25c59-3ba3-46ea-af94-698a1af83712-3
00:17:27.078 --> 00:17:28.040
mental stamina.

438ae7c0-902e-4860-a097-58f80e6300bd-0
00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:38.469
There is convincing scientific evidence
that physical training in the form of

438ae7c0-902e-4860-a097-58f80e6300bd-1
00:17:38.469 --> 00:17:44.303
resistance training and or endurance
training can reduce and prevent chronic

438ae7c0-902e-4860-a097-58f80e6300bd-2
00:17:44.303 --> 00:17:49.758
pain and this did a study from last year
on surgeons but even mentioned

438ae7c0-902e-4860-a097-58f80e6300bd-3
00:17:49.758 --> 00:17:55.591
interventional radiologists concluded
that work induced musculoskeletal pain

438ae7c0-902e-4860-a097-58f80e6300bd-4
00:17:55.591 --> 00:18:01.273
has a negative effect on both work
capacity and also increases the risk of

438ae7c0-902e-4860-a097-58f80e6300bd-5
00:18:01.273 --> 00:18:01.880
burnout.

dc16d790-662e-42ed-b6f2-9e444be827d0-0
00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:07.565
Participants performed resistance
training twice a week with improved neck

dc16d790-662e-42ed-b6f2-9e444be827d0-1
00:18:07.565 --> 00:18:08.440
and back pain.

e8630245-20b6-4174-a292-f91b4ddb0e93-0
00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:14.319
The study also mentioned that resistance
training improves bone density and

e8630245-20b6-4174-a292-f91b4ddb0e93-1
00:18:14.319 --> 00:18:16.120
reduces all 'cause mortality.

1096c187-667d-4d10-aef1-d6481d3ecf22-0
00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:21.600
So what about posture?

b456dc2a-279c-4941-b15b-0465b8de8cf2-0
00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:24.221
Well,
we know that there is a relationship

b456dc2a-279c-4941-b15b-0465b8de8cf2-1
00:18:24.221 --> 00:18:28.000
between a slouching posture and the risk
of musculoskeletal pain.

1286e0e7-a73d-40fd-9c8b-a093292fecea-0
00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:33.060
Anterior pelvic tilt can be associated
with back pain,

1286e0e7-a73d-40fd-9c8b-a093292fecea-1
00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:37.040
and postural training can reduce
musculoskeletal pain.

29cc933b-91fc-48fe-a6f3-aa26e6dc145d-0
00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:43.798
Furthermore,
studies show that a bad posture can

29cc933b-91fc-48fe-a6f3-aa26e6dc145d-1
00:18:43.798 --> 00:18:48.720
affect cognitive performance as well as
increased stress.

6823b863-3bc6-4901-a5e2-3aab1d413fb4-0
00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:56.440
So how do we best prevent and mitigate
musculoskeletal pain?

f6912c9c-c912-4d0f-a4a8-a8c65b379953-0
00:18:56.560 --> 00:19:01.140
As interventional radiologists,
I have chosen to focus on three main

f6912c9c-c912-4d0f-a4a8-a8c65b379953-1
00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:06.120
areas, namely resistance training,
aerobic training and postural training.

68c8e49c-c6d4-4c37-98f5-c0e93e3768af-0
00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:15.377
When it comes to resistance training,
2 to 3 workouts a week up to one hour in

68c8e49c-c6d4-4c37-98f5-c0e93e3768af-1
00:19:15.377 --> 00:19:21.160
duration should be sufficient with a
focus on back, hips, core and shoulders.

f7fef52e-06bf-44b7-920f-46465d918b17-0
00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:27.135
Compound movements are preferred with
free weights as they are more time

f7fef52e-06bf-44b7-920f-46465d918b17-1
00:19:27.135 --> 00:19:31.834
efficient and also best activate the
trunk stabilizers which are crucial for

f7fef52e-06bf-44b7-920f-46465d918b17-2
00:19:31.834 --> 00:19:33.360
enduring long procedures.

4d3c5c08-257e-4acc-a455-8fff0fd8e6a0-0
00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:38.706
We also know that resistance training can
improve tendon strength and stiffness and

4d3c5c08-257e-4acc-a455-8fff0fd8e6a0-1
00:19:38.706 --> 00:19:40.400
also keep our joints healthy.

3810080d-4015-4844-8eb6-e7b36dded30e-0
00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:48.477
So for the back and hips I would choose a
squat variation either with a barbell or

3810080d-4015-4844-8eb6-e7b36dded30e-1
00:19:48.477 --> 00:19:49.080
dumbbells.

b360ae36-aca1-4038-9638-584df8997dd2-0
00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:53.520
The squat can be done as a regular back
squat or a single leg squat.

0ebc9fea-e5a0-48aa-b278-2e7a27c4db6e-0
00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:58.449
The single leg squat puts more emphasis
on the trunk stabilisers and balance,

0ebc9fea-e5a0-48aa-b278-2e7a27c4db6e-1
00:19:58.449 --> 00:20:00.000
but less stress on the lower.

1db62d6b-bf84-4e22-b6d5-0873634343fe-0
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:00.400
Back.

1645e2a2-ef46-4ff9-8a2f-8ebd734a8d97-0
00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:05.501
Squats should be combined with a hip
hinge movement,

1645e2a2-ef46-4ff9-8a2f-8ebd734a8d97-1
00:20:05.501 --> 00:20:10.269
preferably some kind of deadlift,
which also can be performed with a

1645e2a2-ef46-4ff9-8a2f-8ebd734a8d97-2
00:20:10.269 --> 00:20:11.720
barbell or dumbbells.

cd309705-14db-497e-82e7-b6ee5a6148d2-0
00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.650
The hinge put more emphasis on the
posterior chain musculature that,

cd309705-14db-497e-82e7-b6ee5a6148d2-1
00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:22.840
combined with the trunk stabilisers,
play an important role for our posture.

7a0385a2-86e4-48e0-9e1d-ddefe5807e57-0
00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:33.435
To further train the core muscles,
I recommend different static hold planks

7a0385a2-86e4-48e0-9e1d-ddefe5807e57-1
00:20:33.435 --> 00:20:34.280
variations.

8c0ffaf6-52c1-464c-b68f-0a72f90249eb-0
00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:43.251
When it comes to the upper body and
shoulders,

8c0ffaf6-52c1-464c-b68f-0a72f90249eb-1
00:20:43.251 --> 00:20:46.780
choose a push and a pull variation using
dumbbells or a barbell.

b1a68221-9eba-4311-a08c-e38e0de023b8-0
00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:51.685
Strength training machines can also be
used since the upper body movements are

b1a68221-9eba-4311-a08c-e38e0de023b8-1
00:20:51.685 --> 00:20:56.100
not as depending on dependent on core
stability as the lower body movements are.

6cf6d80f-ba74-4ed2-9b8d-efeb214f3b69-0
00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:01.836
For example bench press or dumbbell press
combined with a barbell or dumble row or

6cf6d80f-ba74-4ed2-9b8d-efeb214f3b69-1
00:21:01.836 --> 00:21:03.040
a pull down machine.

8a867cd7-b38e-4643-92a6-e8830e3c0081-0
00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:11.570
As for aerobic exercise,
you can choose more or less anything you

8a867cd7-b38e-4643-92a6-e8830e3c0081-1
00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:16.545
like as long as it's conducted with a
continuous pace or as interval training

8a867cd7-b38e-4643-92a6-e8830e3c0081-2
00:21:16.545 --> 00:21:17.120
or every.

fd326b8e-e3c5-4288-891c-e22e3642db07-0
00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:21.254
If you do a lot of resistance training,
especially for the legs,

fd326b8e-e3c5-4288-891c-e22e3642db07-1
00:21:21.254 --> 00:21:26.280
I would recommend moderate intensity in
order to provide for optimal recovery.

37e7d796-5fbf-4b9c-9792-956a84f214e1-0
00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:37.169
So postural training has gained interest,
increasing interest within the physical

37e7d796-5fbf-4b9c-9792-956a84f214e1-1
00:21:37.169 --> 00:21:40.760
therapy and fitness communities in recent
years.

a8ca08c5-bb57-4cb9-96e0-a3c1ea2724a6-0
00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:45.480
To start with postural training,
there is a lot of resources online.

a7f04dd2-9dad-4a85-a9dc-a20e6105cdde-0
00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:53.046
These exercises can be performed either
following a manual or under the

a7f04dd2-9dad-4a85-a9dc-a20e6105cdde-1
00:21:53.046 --> 00:21:55.080
supervision of a coach.

50c87201-9cf2-422e-a668-328a5484eef7-0
00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:02.591
The exercises are normally prescribed as
a menu depending on your individual

50c87201-9cf2-422e-a668-328a5484eef7-1
00:22:02.591 --> 00:22:09.269
individual postural dysfunctions and some
general considerations for physical

50c87201-9cf2-422e-a668-328a5484eef7-2
00:22:09.269 --> 00:22:10.040
training.

3cfd2e17-1527-4b63-98ee-72112841f7c4-0
00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:13.300
First and foremost,
and especially when it comes to

3cfd2e17-1527-4b63-98ee-72112841f7c4-1
00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:17.240
resistance training with three weights,
learn and focus on proper technique.

39faafc5-7dbc-449f-a2ce-73280ac43cfb-0
00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:22.320
This is key for preventing injury and
improper movement patterns.

230cf8c7-6be3-42f4-b354-9c661ff17d33-0
00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:24.440
And be consistent.

b187ee3b-e4de-49e4-82bc-55541b5d9606-0
00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:28.080
Consistency leads to adaptation of time.

372c38b0-f75b-4896-8a3c-725ef4b5fd6d-0
00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:33.638
Use progressive overload overload,
gradually increase the resistance

372c38b0-f75b-4896-8a3c-725ef4b5fd6d-1
00:22:33.638 --> 00:22:38.505
intensity and training time,
and remember that you can't achieve good

372c38b0-f75b-4896-8a3c-725ef4b5fd6d-2
00:22:38.505 --> 00:22:42.399
training results without proper nutrition
and recovery.

0d220771-006e-46b1-907f-2cc644752a4f-0
00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:48.520
If possible,
take micro pulses between interventions.

413b1ede-bda7-49a8-b4dc-1532d1013d49-0
00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:53.600
This can be very effective a way to
decompress both your body and your mind.

03510a4c-d0df-4ebf-ab4d-b51781962d77-0
00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:59.359
So in summary,
regular physical training is beneficial

03510a4c-d0df-4ebf-ab4d-b51781962d77-1
00:22:59.359 --> 00:23:01.640
for interventional radiologists.

eea26e40-0a19-4b52-baa6-826913fdeeee-0
00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:06.626
Resistance training using compound
movements targeting back, hips,

eea26e40-0a19-4b52-baa6-826913fdeeee-1
00:23:06.626 --> 00:23:08.760
core and shoulders is effective.

482b6a21-b92d-4fa5-9172-8ecc29266edd-0
00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:12.520
Aerobic exercise and aniform is
recommended.

56a159c9-4340-40cf-afb2-78267f4ecc6f-0
00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:19.427
2:00 to 3:00 work UPS per week up to
about an hour is sufficient and postural

56a159c9-4340-40cf-afb2-78267f4ecc6f-1
00:23:19.427 --> 00:23:21.360
training can be of value.

029e058c-a320-4d4b-b40f-3246632572c1-0
00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:23.560
Thank you very much.

b7b5e28c-2b4c-4029-865b-6ec430a19856-0
00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:28.720
Thanks for having me everyone.

b6a86bfe-5e26-459c-a5a9-dfdc218d77b6-0
00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:30.800
My name is Andrea Tagari.

c34a5761-acc5-422e-a4d3-6f2d9d1e5014-0
00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:34.360
I'm an interventional cardiologist
practicing in Toronto, Canada.

969f5e67-b521-4f86-995f-5657d2528481-0
00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:39.894
So I'm going to keep this practical and
discuss how we protect both from

969f5e67-b521-4f86-995f-5657d2528481-1
00:23:39.894 --> 00:23:42.400
radiation and from orthopaedic strain.

24849c01-084d-41ca-8ab4-1518d2ef4915-0
00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:47.200
And I'll show you how we what we use in
our lab and why.

25097904-bc12-4692-a3e3-58e968a508be-0
00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:52.280
The goal is to pick one change that you
can start as soon as possible.

40e8f539-24e1-48b2-ad37-ea3aa5188bd1-0
00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:59.214
Scattered to the head and neck is a
career long exposure and the weight of

40e8f539-24e1-48b2-ad37-ea3aa5188bd1-1
00:23:59.214 --> 00:24:03.239
lead plus reach and rotation,
specifically with increasing radial

40e8f539-24e1-48b2-ad37-ea3aa5188bd1-2
00:24:03.239 --> 00:24:06.959
approach and left radial drives real
musculoskeletal issues.

ac402888-ce1c-497b-bc7f-2d0f48dea678-0
00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:11.560
If we only solve for dose or only for
posture, we miss the point.

0fe8ee84-a63c-4917-9d20-53f3310042dc-0
00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:12.280
We need both.

7ea2c2a8-3b29-4c63-ad89-02ff006b6dfb-0
00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:22.357
You'll see two baselines,
absolute and absolute reductions and

7ea2c2a8-3b29-4c63-ad89-02ff006b6dfb-1
00:24:22.357 --> 00:24:27.189
unshielded and incremental reductions on
top of standard setup,

7ea2c2a8-3b29-4c63-ad89-02ff006b6dfb-2
00:24:27.189 --> 00:24:32.400
which usually consists of an apron,
ceiling screen and table skirts.

61054867-a427-4963-8c28-ed70d60c5cae-0
00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:35.600
Angles, energy,
distance and placement matter.

2cc27e1e-bfd9-49e7-8d62-887f49aceade-0
00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:40.954
So treat the folded numbers as ballpark
and pay attention to the evidence type to

2cc27e1e-bfd9-49e7-8d62-887f49aceade-1
00:24:40.954 --> 00:24:44.385
understand whether it's derived from
phantom or bench,

2cc27e1e-bfd9-49e7-8d62-887f49aceade-2
00:24:44.385 --> 00:24:46.880
real world observational or RCT studies.

f7306e4e-b762-499c-94cb-11fd0cbcf3f3-0
00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:55.578
Aprons and collars are the foundation as
they provide excellent torso attenuation,

f7306e4e-b762-499c-94cb-11fd0cbcf3f3-1
00:24:55.578 --> 00:25:00.397
but they don't protect the head and eyes
by themselves and the weight adds up over

f7306e4e-b762-499c-94cb-11fd0cbcf3f3-2
00:25:00.397 --> 00:25:00.920
a career.

2c5b7229-9bbe-4b80-83d0-c71697523ec8-0
00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:03.840
That's why we layer upstream protections.

e949761b-6014-48cc-b17b-d03a46e1abfa-0
00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:07.720
Most operators and even nurses wear lead
glasses as well these days.

9d474671-1cdf-47bb-a00a-705adf169610-0
00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:15.827
Ceiling suspended and table skirts were
the next barriers adopted and became the

9d474671-1cdf-47bb-a00a-705adf169610-1
00:25:15.827 --> 00:25:17.000
standard of care.

89f7ab2f-0275-4bf9-8c28-6254d7de0eb3-0
00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:20.464
When the ceiling shield is close and
stable,

89f7ab2f-0275-4bf9-8c28-6254d7de0eb3-1
00:25:20.464 --> 00:25:22.840
head and chest dose can drop dramatically.

138de3d8-e917-4ca9-8e7d-8dff0e6519cd-0
00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:26.120
Table skirts protect the legs and pelvis.

ee33746d-2a4e-460b-beb4-53ffc1c721b5-0
00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:27.840
The key is consistency.

0c9fccee-0aec-432c-8b71-7b8c96b91dc1-0
00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:32.454
Drift and steep angles can erase the
benefits or proper repositioning

0c9fccee-0aec-432c-8b71-7b8c96b91dc1-1
00:25:32.454 --> 00:25:33.960
continuously is critical.

3f98ca6e-02f1-4083-a33c-6246fe255384-0
00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:43.788
Patient side drapes are adjuncts near the
source to fill gaps when the ceiling

3f98ca6e-02f1-4083-a33c-6246fe255384-1
00:25:43.788 --> 00:25:44.960
screen isn't enough.

6603dfcb-6d97-4bb5-8dfe-27599a9e5f76-0
00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:48.000
Typical additional reduction over
standard shielding.

cfacea55-5197-4372-8adb-7d6631797991-0
00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.480
Shielding is about 20 to 60%,
but results are placement dependent.

071eec96-84a1-4d88-a55d-e3cf333e2133-0
00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:58.200
The drapes can sometimes obstruct access
and are disposable after only one use of.

13f54a90-cabe-415f-ad3f-5dfdf3800f7f-0
00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:01.080
This limits their general practicality.

80b12999-2370-427a-8331-5671afa1ce53-0
00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:11.368
Suspended systems are one of the first
new innovations beyond standard Shields

80b12999-2370-427a-8331-5671afa1ce53-1
00:26:11.368 --> 00:26:16.200
and offload the apron weight and provide
strong protection for the wearer.

8cbb22f9-d94a-4aac-8466-0e6f66815eb1-0
00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:20.837
They're great for backs and necks,
but you still need room shielding to

8cbb22f9-d94a-4aac-8466-0e6f66815eb1-1
00:26:20.837 --> 00:26:22.480
protect the rest of the team.

f33655e7-a2f4-4611-8229-4afd84bab713-0
00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:28.080
Mobility and use in different sides of
the table can also make it less versatile.

94b68afb-757a-4cdb-a69d-886a98467ec6-0
00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:34.200
So this has limited the adoption of the
suspended protection.

e1a4d4c5-4799-4596-a187-ce69bb55fb25-0
00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:44.320
More lately a comprehensive barriers have
come into the market and they provide

e1a4d4c5-4799-4596-a187-ce69bb55fb25-1
00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:49.600
much more protection of our bodies to the
room or the the imager.

d2801039-b5d8-49bc-b761-c09e5f809763-0
00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:53.440
So coverage becomes reliable and team
wide.

7b60a42f-c5ef-45c6-8f85-1a67152ff011-0
00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:59.551
So examples include Rampart, Portego,
egg nest and the CR mounted options like

7b60a42f-c5ef-45c6-8f85-1a67152ff011-1
00:26:59.551 --> 00:27:00.480
Radioaction.

f70d19db-a26a-4980-b1ec-0966a99175f9-0
00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:06.171
Across the category,
reductions versus standard care or

f70d19db-a26a-4980-b1ec-0966a99175f9-1
00:27:06.171 --> 00:27:12.391
protection are typically very,
very high in the order of 90 to 98 or 99%

f70d19db-a26a-4980-b1ec-0966a99175f9-2
00:27:12.391 --> 00:27:15.799
when compared to the standard shielding.

12dbb28c-90e7-4ee1-b2bf-08f466a73ba3-0
00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:20.720
This has been quite an advancement
compared to what we've seen in the past.

2c9c1517-df0b-4d6d-9b5e-07d62931dae0-0
00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:25.480
It's important to consider the residuals.

85986e9f-fdde-4e4e-9d10-1e2904f39d96-0
00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:32.073
Programs often see about 1 to 2 MIC
receivers per case at the operator or

85986e9f-fdde-4e4e-9d10-1e2904f39d96-1
00:27:32.073 --> 00:27:38.728
assistant shoulder and it's not uncommon
to see 0 dose cases where physics and

85986e9f-fdde-4e4e-9d10-1e2904f39d96-2
00:27:38.728 --> 00:27:40.160
policy supported.

ab0e1006-8e82-4ea9-aa29-fbaa7d206a4a-0
00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:43.800
The apron optional pathway is something
to consider.

14ff0e88-b1a9-45cb-a343-f253381c32bb-0
00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:48.095
It's also helpful to think about
protection for assistance and

14ff0e88-b1a9-45cb-a343-f253381c32bb-1
00:27:48.095 --> 00:27:52.671
echocardiographers and anaesthesiologist,
not just the primary operators,

14ff0e88-b1a9-45cb-a343-f253381c32bb-2
00:27:52.671 --> 00:27:56.999
as they will be positioned at other
points of the table for different

14ff0e88-b1a9-45cb-a343-f253381c32bb-3
00:27:56.999 --> 00:27:57.680
procedures.

10f7e8ab-3f81-42eb-af5e-c1de859510e0-0
00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:03.216
It's also important to think about how
and where the decimeters were used to

10f7e8ab-3f81-42eb-af5e-c1de859510e0-1
00:28:03.216 --> 00:28:04.920
measure the reported doses.

dc35babe-023b-4907-8ce7-7de5525b8965-0
00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:14.901
So for ergonomic supports,
this is the other half of the the

dc35babe-023b-4907-8ce7-7de5525b8965-1
00:28:14.901 --> 00:28:15.760
equation.

fcd32b61-f939-4a30-ac5f-f787c56350ab-0
00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:18.280
There are a few options available.

267b6cf7-b52b-43ac-a037-393f298c6592-0
00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:23.560
Some of them provide the extra added
benefit of radiation reduction as well.

5f4b85e2-5dc2-46d8-9906-06da13d4cf4d-0
00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:27.508
As an example,
the Armory system supports both right and

5f4b85e2-5dc2-46d8-9906-06da13d4cf4d-1
00:28:27.508 --> 00:28:32.664
left radial and in an RCT demonstrated an
additional 60% operator dose reduction

5f4b85e2-5dc2-46d8-9906-06da13d4cf4d-2
00:28:32.664 --> 00:28:34.320
beyond standard shielding.

9be13633-9743-4b40-9a86-5cbfc743b775-0
00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:41.139
Others have phantom only data and
sometimes if a board is actually in the

9be13633-9743-4b40-9a86-5cbfc743b775-1
00:28:41.139 --> 00:28:45.256
radiation beam,
it may block where the shield needs to

9be13633-9743-4b40-9a86-5cbfc743b775-2
00:28:45.256 --> 00:28:51.320
sit and it can actually cause radiation
scatter to actually go up in some cases.

3a1d82a8-ba69-47e4-8da5-19ed3a078866-0
00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:54.800
So proper integration with a good board
is important.

e046f662-7962-4689-9a67-f195e466fe11-0
00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:03.320
So a word about apron optional status.

da621e70-281e-4c91-9f7c-fcaae8208c15-0
00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:07.400
Apron optional status is a policy
decision, not a product label.

adb06eb5-5368-4627-b7c8-9c58228ebdc6-0
00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:13.376
Programs that adopt it typically present
physics evidence of very low residual

adb06eb5-5368-4627-b7c8-9c58228ebdc6-1
00:29:13.376 --> 00:29:16.796
staff dose,
confirm with the monitored pilot using

adb06eb5-5368-4627-b7c8-9c58228ebdc6-2
00:29:16.796 --> 00:29:21.690
extra head and collar to symmetry,
and maintain governance with periodic

adb06eb5-5368-4627-b7c8-9c58228ebdc6-3
00:29:21.690 --> 00:29:22.160
audits.

2265b6c0-5b04-4370-a02b-e11bbbb7e96d-0
00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:25.413
In the US,
approvals are handled by the institution

2265b6c0-5b04-4370-a02b-e11bbbb7e96d-1
00:29:25.413 --> 00:29:28.080
level and usually require state approval
as well.

1d676ff4-5f35-4642-8d22-e8839ac90b22-0
00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:32.852
In Canada, where I practice,
there's currently no provision to accept

1d676ff4-5f35-4642-8d22-e8839ac90b22-1
00:29:32.852 --> 00:29:37.956
an apron optional status and sites simply
follow the safety code guidance under the

1d676ff4-5f35-4642-8d22-e8839ac90b22-2
00:29:37.956 --> 00:29:39.840
RSO and Medical Physics review.

3cad2a45-1018-4674-977b-4304bdb11d83-0
00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:43.480
But we are currently working to actually
make advancements in this area.

a5428b2a-a5db-4b07-9944-d68e6d5fc38d-0
00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:52.120
So I'll just kind of briefly go through
what we currently use in our lab.

53b6a66b-653a-4e6b-b2cd-1c3ded1613df-0
00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:56.768
We have a Rampart Defender,
the floor based shielding model and it's

53b6a66b-653a-4e6b-b2cd-1c3ded1613df-1
00:29:56.768 --> 00:30:01.897
paired with their table mounted shielding
for full team coverage on that side of

53b6a66b-653a-4e6b-b2cd-1c3ded1613df-2
00:30:01.897 --> 00:30:05.000
the table,
which is how our current workflow is.

3386401d-d77e-4e54-ac15-af6a0efdd2f1-0
00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:09.760
And we also use the Armory radial boards
for added ergonomics.

62f7f546-c4b2-4fff-8530-5d11411d7a87-0
00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:15.631
We are a 95% radial site,
so we definitely appreciate the the added

62f7f546-c4b2-4fff-8530-5d11411d7a87-1
00:30:15.631 --> 00:30:16.840
benefit there.

d48fb87c-d7c5-4d6c-bbf0-2efb2ca21653-0
00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:22.484
We chose this combination because of its
clinical evidence and in the US the apron

d48fb87c-d7c5-4d6c-bbf0-2efb2ca21653-1
00:30:22.484 --> 00:30:26.904
optional experience aligns with the apron
optional pathway that we're actively

d48fb87c-d7c5-4d6c-bbf0-2efb2ca21653-2
00:30:26.904 --> 00:30:28.080
pursuing at our site.

d880edae-9312-43f0-b39d-8ce05e12d5a3-0
00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:33.201
So this will involve some Health Canada
supported approval with our RSO and

d880edae-9312-43f0-b39d-8ce05e12d5a3-1
00:30:33.201 --> 00:30:37.648
medical team while we work,
while we allow the workflow to remain

d880edae-9312-43f0-b39d-8ce05e12d5a3-2
00:30:37.648 --> 00:30:38.120
smooth.

e177c3d6-7278-4946-9397-42013ba50306-0
00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:43.126
So in the images on the right hand side,
you can actually see the way that access

e177c3d6-7278-4946-9397-42013ba50306-1
00:30:43.126 --> 00:30:47.120
can be maintained quite comfortably with
the patient's arm fully abducted.

fe611d37-cf9d-4612-8493-a47da7b2133a-0
00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:50.660
Following this,
the device actually can fold up to

fe611d37-cf9d-4612-8493-a47da7b2133a-1
00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:55.040
support the patient's left humerus,
really locking the elbow into place,

fe611d37-cf9d-4612-8493-a47da7b2133a-2
00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:59.660
which both keeps the patient quite
comfortable and does not allow the arm to

fe611d37-cf9d-4612-8493-a47da7b2133a-3
00:30:59.660 --> 00:30:59.960
move.

ef44ef5f-4bd0-4af6-9b50-57c83cd9f398-0
00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:05.122
And the lower left hand side,
you can see that the left radial is

ef44ef5f-4bd0-4af6-9b50-57c83cd9f398-1
00:31:05.122 --> 00:31:09.125
actually quite accessible,
probably about the midline between the

ef44ef5f-4bd0-4af6-9b50-57c83cd9f398-2
00:31:09.125 --> 00:31:10.519
two femoral axis sites.

ff30f546-3ae6-490b-b028-8fac6f87778e-0
00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:11.960
So quite comfortable.

3c599f70-ebb3-4840-b872-b3e6f9b6b8be-0
00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:15.569
You can see how you're able to actually
stand with a fairly straight spine

3c599f70-ebb3-4840-b872-b3e6f9b6b8be-1
00:31:15.569 --> 00:31:18.360
without having to reach across,
which can be a real pain.

946ea272-fbd9-4023-ac3b-f9d88009571a-0
00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:22.872
I used to hate left radio because of the
support issues,

946ea272-fbd9-4023-ac3b-f9d88009571a-1
00:31:22.872 --> 00:31:27.480
but since using proper support it makes
it much much less cumbersome.

3e2b4ece-3c1a-4363-8eff-ed6a27cf4b1f-0
00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:36.682
So when you pull it, put it all together,
you need to set up the room so that

3e2b4ece-3c1a-4363-8eff-ed6a27cf4b1f-1
00:31:36.682 --> 00:31:41.782
scatter paths are enclosed,
drapes are actually put on and and do not

3e2b4ece-3c1a-4363-8eff-ed6a27cf4b1f-2
00:31:41.782 --> 00:31:47.320
move and you do a quick shield gap huddle
before the first case of the day.

0d671aff-0eed-495a-9652-d5edb28251fc-0
00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:54.661
You can keep a simply simple monthly
dashboard and track dose by a role of the

0d671aff-0eed-495a-9652-d5edb28251fc-1
00:31:54.661 --> 00:31:57.800
personnel keep monitoring the shield.

ffecd8a4-0cfa-4fb5-934e-c8e9440892e1-0
00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:03.080
Use a real time monitoring is actually an
excellent adjunct as well and following

ffecd8a4-0cfa-4fb5-934e-c8e9440892e1-1
00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:08.360
apron hours for the staff and then doing
a 90 day examination to see where you're

ffecd8a4-0cfa-4fb5-934e-c8e9440892e1-2
00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:13.640
at in terms of progress is excellent as
well to kind of really show the benefits.

93524e0e-0935-424c-9236-bf04e9edebcf-0
00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:20.213
So my advice is to pick one barrier
change,

93524e0e-0935-424c-9236-bf04e9edebcf-1
00:32:20.213 --> 00:32:25.680
one ergonomic habit and some support for
that as well.

4ab38abd-f0f5-4127-84b1-59be73a6121d-0
00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:26.720
And one metric.

3925deb0-a1fc-4735-b66a-4f2201723404-0
00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.080
This is not something that needs to wait.

f1e9af40-87a4-4b40-b9da-17bed6727c88-0
00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:32.871
In fact,
I would urge you all to try and champion

f1e9af40-87a4-4b40-b9da-17bed6727c88-1
00:32:32.871 --> 00:32:34.160
this in my sight.

4f5d291b-3977-4137-b26c-025834f3817f-0
00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:39.600
It took someone like myself to basically
make this an urgent need.

6b93ef8c-074f-4109-9a26-58b24fd589b8-0
00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:44.655
And with with the support from colleagues,
this is something that everybody can make

6b93ef8c-074f-4109-9a26-58b24fd589b8-1
00:32:44.655 --> 00:32:46.160
happen at their own center.

057dd91b-8708-4991-bca8-86b8073e1cc3-0
00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:50.269
So I urge you actually to start the
conversations and see what works for your

057dd91b-8708-4991-bca8-86b8073e1cc3-1
00:32:50.269 --> 00:32:54.378
lab in terms of your workflow and try to
make the changes as soon as possible

057dd91b-8708-4991-bca8-86b8073e1cc3-2
00:32:54.378 --> 00:32:58.435
because it this is a lasting change
that's going to benefit you for the rest

057dd91b-8708-4991-bca8-86b8073e1cc3-3
00:32:58.435 --> 00:32:59.120
of the years.

259a8be5-dd52-4074-8ee2-07754656a175-0
00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:03.800
So I'll have happy to answer any
questions in the panel discussion.

85c6799d-7ca0-4775-89a2-6d626546ba62-0
00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:04.960
Thank you so much for your time.

f04acd86-97c9-4190-a99c-049a15c3d6c9-0
00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:10.352
Thank you and welcome back to the
question answer part of Session 3,

f04acd86-97c9-4190-a99c-049a15c3d6c9-1
00:33:10.352 --> 00:33:14.076
which were some great talks,
protecting your body and preventing

f04acd86-97c9-4190-a99c-049a15c3d6c9-2
00:33:14.076 --> 00:33:17.169
injury and fatigue,
which we all seem to have in this

f04acd86-97c9-4190-a99c-049a15c3d6c9-3
00:33:17.169 --> 00:33:17.800
profession.

23a6cbc8-d983-464e-ba20-7907c29c4320-0
00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:20.656
We have a great,
great group of panelists here that's

23a6cbc8-d983-464e-ba20-7907c29c4320-1
00:33:20.656 --> 00:33:21.600
going to weigh into it.

c5d0eac0-aa71-4168-a35b-67af49033eb9-0
00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:22.800
They can answer your questions.

2f0c4d5a-e2aa-474e-b6b6-ed7447c17ca8-0
00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:25.234
Again,
just send us your questions and we'll try

2f0c4d5a-e2aa-474e-b6b6-ed7447c17ca8-1
00:33:25.234 --> 00:33:25.880
to answer it.

83e284ac-c3bd-49e5-ad6f-74b36395d7d3-0
00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:30.728
While we have these experts here,
we have doctor Audra Kocher should be

83e284ac-c3bd-49e5-ad6f-74b36395d7d3-1
00:33:30.728 --> 00:33:32.480
joining us any any minute.

bea87efd-dc93-4807-9fe1-1c72000966bf-0
00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:35.974
He's from Brigham Women's and really a
specialist and, and,

bea87efd-dc93-4807-9fe1-1c72000966bf-1
00:33:35.974 --> 00:33:40.400
and doing a lot of research on the
ergonomic strain that we're all feeling.

48cb666d-64b6-4f34-ba98-91471335436a-0
00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:45.081
Doctor Erickson from Sweden,
he's an interventional radiologist and I

48cb666d-64b6-4f34-ba98-91471335436a-1
00:33:45.081 --> 00:33:48.960
wish we all looked like him physically
from the pictures.

a4e5a24a-e9e6-4c4e-a7a2-3e7b62243794-0
00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:51.680
Oh, thank you.

2af3df72-f763-44df-8278-2595e2a27815-0
00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:52.720
Great.

774bf566-00fc-4f3c-ba74-a9053980b7d8-0
00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:57.404
And then we have Doctor Yadagari from the
interventional cardiologist in

774bf566-00fc-4f3c-ba74-a9053980b7d8-1
00:33:57.404 --> 00:33:58.880
Scarborough, ON Canada.

e4b29059-0d80-4109-926d-11cab7aa1f99-0
00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:01.600
So have some, have a great panel here.

b2d66a14-b967-47bb-8717-476c21b9993b-0
00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:04.660
And again,
hopefully you'll you'll send in send in

b2d66a14-b967-47bb-8717-476c21b9993b-1
00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:06.040
some of your questions.

e3717172-a386-4b42-ae82-abcef2a21d8e-0
00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:09.960
I want to start off and then we have
doctor Bella Hausen, who is a Co director.

a0e56759-e1da-45d7-b6c0-529611d8571e-0
00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:14.309
She's going to kind of also help with
some questions and love the panel to

a0e56759-e1da-45d7-b6c0-529611d8571e-1
00:34:14.309 --> 00:34:17.846
weigh in as well,
because this ought to be a very, you know,

a0e56759-e1da-45d7-b6c0-529611d8571e-2
00:34:17.846 --> 00:34:19.760
a really good dynamic discussion.

58ef35d1-448b-4f9f-a387-a9a22dacca94-0
00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.328
Have a little bit more time on this one
than we have had on some of the other

58ef35d1-448b-4f9f-a387-a9a22dacca94-1
00:34:23.328 --> 00:34:23.840
discussions.

0b12fd37-2420-404e-af52-6406fe699bf1-0
00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:27.240
So hopefully we can dive deep,
really dive deep into this.

773f798d-74d9-4724-ba72-540df79621e5-0
00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:30.841
First thing I want to ask you,
Doctor Erickson is, well,

773f798d-74d9-4724-ba72-540df79621e5-1
00:34:30.841 --> 00:34:33.754
first tell you a story that that I was
last week,

773f798d-74d9-4724-ba72-540df79621e5-2
00:34:33.754 --> 00:34:38.124
he got walking in my neighborhood and I
saw one of my previous partners in

773f798d-74d9-4724-ba72-540df79621e5-3
00:34:38.124 --> 00:34:42.319
interventional cardiology and he was
walking down the road with a ruck.

513d7dff-a217-4ab8-97c4-f107cabd9f22-0
00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:45.520
And I guess that's the new thing now,
those ruck exercises.

c1bb87ca-e8c9-4c3b-88c7-1698d3246515-0
00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:51.154
So he had a weighted vest and and that
seems to be the thing to do here now is

c1bb87ca-e8c9-4c3b-88c7-1698d3246515-1
00:34:51.154 --> 00:34:54.360
wearing those weighted vests when you
exercise.

61cacedf-d38e-4017-b29c-9f9ec69527f5-0
00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:56.000
You think that's a good thing or a bad
thing?

8b1777c3-1423-47f5-bfa2-6c134898d0e2-0
00:34:58.160 --> 00:34:59.360
I don't know, actually, I mean it.

ada5adfe-55de-49e4-b99b-4424b068602c-0
00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:03.840
I think,
I think that the reason why people are

ada5adfe-55de-49e4-b99b-4424b068602c-1
00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:07.550
doing this is that, you know, you,
you increase the,

ada5adfe-55de-49e4-b99b-4424b068602c-2
00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:11.540
the load and the energy expenditure,
you know, per step,

ada5adfe-55de-49e4-b99b-4424b068602c-3
00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:15.320
but it also makes your joints, you know,
work harder.

8ebaa28b-5c54-4328-bd28-0f23f23737e9-0
00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:19.320
It's extra actual loading on on the body.

2cd56d24-2573-4aa7-b265-f6032b07644e-0
00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:26.251
So I don't know actually if there's any,
any scientific evidence for if it's

2cd56d24-2573-4aa7-b265-f6032b07644e-1
00:35:26.251 --> 00:35:28.720
better than not wearing a vest.

065126e6-8de9-41c2-a454-ff09323a45c1-0
00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:30.720
I mean, I don't personally do it.

69dc9f5b-0fc7-4002-995a-9d7459010f13-0
00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:36.687
I, I, I, I just, you know,
I do my runs and and now perhaps for

69dc9f5b-0fc7-4002-995a-9d7459010f13-1
00:35:36.687 --> 00:35:38.920
walking, it's less stressful.

8c89cc78-5f81-44d0-accf-4e7f9fd46789-0
00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:44.000
So perhaps there you have you.

3e200214-d1b1-4603-a001-2ce23d801cbe-0
00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:48.308
You can use it while walking,
but I don't actually believe wearing it

3e200214-d1b1-4603-a001-2ce23d801cbe-1
00:35:48.308 --> 00:35:52.637
while running because each running step
you take a man it, it's, it's,

3e200214-d1b1-4603-a001-2ce23d801cbe-2
00:35:52.637 --> 00:35:56.051
it's about you increase the load on your
knee and, and,

3e200214-d1b1-4603-a001-2ce23d801cbe-3
00:35:56.051 --> 00:36:00.868
and hip joint by like 3 times your body
weight or even more if you run really,

3e200214-d1b1-4603-a001-2ce23d801cbe-4
00:36:00.868 --> 00:36:01.600
really fast.

da0ae88d-0bbb-4e6d-8df7-8654a3c44048-0
00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:04.240
You know, as the,
as the elite guys or and women do that.

48a31212-c174-4856-be3d-ff35f3ea4a6f-0
00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:07.078
I mean, they,
they really expose their joints to heavy

48a31212-c174-4856-be3d-ff35f3ea4a6f-1
00:36:07.078 --> 00:36:10.948
loading and just increasing that is
something I don't actually believe in,

48a31212-c174-4856-be3d-ff35f3ea4a6f-2
00:36:10.948 --> 00:36:12.600
but that's my personal thoughts.

51c638bb-43b5-425e-88f7-198888425f71-0
00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:16.000
Yeah, yeah.

a2422da4-18d4-44c3-ba18-044fec17920a-0
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.640
And we do some of these exercises.

2b2f90c8-ed63-4415-9b15-e90308eba43f-0
00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:22.524
I guess the question is, is it,
is it better to do it simply daily or pre

2b2f90c8-ed63-4415-9b15-e90308eba43f-1
00:36:22.524 --> 00:36:25.560
procedural, post procedural,
what's is there?

6e2256e2-40c3-400c-871a-a2170ff2a944-0
00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:29.680
Is there a timing that actually helps
that's kind of optimal for us?

18b9e44e-659a-49c4-bf5f-8299bfb341e8-0
00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:32.487
Or is it just the fact that that you do
these exercise routine,

18b9e44e-659a-49c4-bf5f-8299bfb341e8-1
00:36:32.487 --> 00:36:34.680
they will build up the,
the core and the muscles?

bf200238-cee1-4375-93c1-e5cf34b5dd5d-0
00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:39.786
Yeah, I think, I think when,
when it comes to the strength training

bf200238-cee1-4375-93c1-e5cf34b5dd5d-1
00:36:39.786 --> 00:36:44.818
and the, and the, the endurance training,
I mean, as I mentioned in my, in my speak,

bf200238-cee1-4375-93c1-e5cf34b5dd5d-2
00:36:44.818 --> 00:36:46.240
that consistency is key.

f668532b-c235-4afa-866c-5e56c86241db-0
00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:49.312
You know, you have to be consistent and,
and,

f668532b-c235-4afa-866c-5e56c86241db-1
00:36:49.312 --> 00:36:53.320
and work with progressive overload over
time when it comes.

6dd89698-b613-40f5-9e60-ce1d179a61c8-0
00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:57.176
I personally do, when I'm,
I'm very much into postural training

6dd89698-b613-40f5-9e60-ce1d179a61c8-1
00:36:57.176 --> 00:37:02.006
because that is something that really had
made my body and how I feel and I have

6dd89698-b613-40f5-9e60-ce1d179a61c8-2
00:37:02.006 --> 00:37:03.079
moved much better.

b72c2ac9-8e0e-4148-ba58-43696335b216-0
00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:08.858
And I know also a few of my colleagues do
it, you know, they, they, we do like,

b72c2ac9-8e0e-4148-ba58-43696335b216-1
00:37:08.858 --> 00:37:13.120
depending on how you're,
if you have dysfunctions in your,

b72c2ac9-8e0e-4148-ba58-43696335b216-2
00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:17.382
in your posture, if,
if you're like leaning on one side or

b72c2ac9-8e0e-4148-ba58-43696335b216-3
00:37:17.382 --> 00:37:22.800
you're standing more on one foot than the
other, you can do an assessment.

1607d243-bf49-484e-a5fb-198fd6a8f988-0
00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:26.952
And then you get prescribed like a,
like a menu of, of,

1607d243-bf49-484e-a5fb-198fd6a8f988-1
00:37:26.952 --> 00:37:29.400
of postural corrective exercises.

9a5ef078-df42-4e54-805b-7abc12e86010-0
00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:33.747
And I spend like 20 minutes each morning,
you know, after breakfast,

9a5ef078-df42-4e54-805b-7abc12e86010-1
00:37:33.747 --> 00:37:37.616
I do these menus and it feels like I get
more, you know, my, my,

9a5ef078-df42-4e54-805b-7abc12e86010-2
00:37:37.616 --> 00:37:42.200
my body becomes more stacked like this,
you know, it, it feels more relaxed.

8ea7c65f-7396-420b-923c-33102d835492-0
00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:45.240
My, my shoulders come back,
my hips feel more loose.

21367896-b071-434d-b869-71c7653dcbf6-0
00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:47.800
I feel like I'm standing up more straight.

82141463-54d1-4e7d-9433-0e064257ddfa-0
00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:52.920
And that carries over to when I'm in the,
when I'm in the, in the cat lab.

fd0cd436-7a07-40ea-9cbe-b159ad6c34ad-0
00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:56.742
And I, I,
because I think about how I'm standing my,

fd0cd436-7a07-40ea-9cbe-b159ad6c34ad-1
00:37:56.742 --> 00:38:00.060
my,
my weight is more evenly distributed over

fd0cd436-7a07-40ea-9cbe-b159ad6c34ad-2
00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:01.720
my both feet and so on.

794b8435-10b3-4d3f-9232-1666a4af25fb-0
00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:07.146
You know, so I think these things,
I think it's very beneficial to do on a

794b8435-10b3-4d3f-9232-1666a4af25fb-1
00:38:07.146 --> 00:38:12.428
daily basis when it comes to training,
resistance training and endurance

794b8435-10b3-4d3f-9232-1666a4af25fb-2
00:38:12.428 --> 00:38:13.080
training.

26ac479d-ee72-48ac-9dcd-f7597acdffeb-0
00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:17.800
That's a more sensitive matter because it
depends on how much you can take.

b2688d79-1f2d-42c0-adc3-fa524939d1cc-0
00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:20.372
The more you train,
the more you can train,

b2688d79-1f2d-42c0-adc3-fa524939d1cc-1
00:38:20.372 --> 00:38:22.280
you know that that that's how it is.

9f280ebd-20a9-4f80-839d-7a7a28f8ef77-0
00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:25.200
So you you can't bite off more than you
can chew.

2a7f84ae-10d2-4577-8590-dedf9bc98fc4-0
00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:30.029
So I think you have to be, if you,
if you're, if you're new to training,

2a7f84ae-10d2-4577-8590-dedf9bc98fc4-1
00:38:30.029 --> 00:38:35.040
just start gradually and increase over
time and don't, don't get carried away.

ec7a2975-162b-4b36-b6f6-031ec4626b2a-0
00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:38.304
But when it comes to postural training,
I think,

ec7a2975-162b-4b36-b6f6-031ec4626b2a-1
00:38:38.304 --> 00:38:43.118
I think even even between sessions,
I do small corrected exercises, you know,

ec7a2975-162b-4b36-b6f6-031ec4626b2a-2
00:38:43.118 --> 00:38:47.376
depending on where I feel in something in
the shoulder and the neck,

ec7a2975-162b-4b36-b6f6-031ec4626b2a-3
00:38:47.376 --> 00:38:51.449
I do specific exercises for that,
you know, and if I feel my, my,

ec7a2975-162b-4b36-b6f6-031ec4626b2a-4
00:38:51.449 --> 00:38:54.597
my lower back,
I can decompress for a few minutes,

ec7a2975-162b-4b36-b6f6-031ec4626b2a-5
00:38:54.597 --> 00:38:58.670
you know, So that is something I, I,
I actually recommend that's,

ec7a2975-162b-4b36-b6f6-031ec4626b2a-6
00:38:58.670 --> 00:38:59.719
that's fantastic.

190f60cf-0107-46c8-a8b3-b8e9552b9b72-0
00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:05.032
Before I get to Doctor Kocher,
I wanted to ask Doctor Yargari about,

190f60cf-0107-46c8-a8b3-b8e9552b9b72-1
00:39:05.032 --> 00:39:09.492
I think that we are obviously in the US
adopting more of a radial,

190f60cf-0107-46c8-a8b3-b8e9552b9b72-2
00:39:09.492 --> 00:39:13.419
radial approach,
but certainly haven't gotten to the level

190f60cf-0107-46c8-a8b3-b8e9552b9b72-3
00:39:13.419 --> 00:39:17.680
that you have in Canada and doing right
radial and left radial.

057e7b45-9606-441d-9963-9f7b693cf08c-0
00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:20.841
And,
and I guess what ergonomic positions that

057e7b45-9606-441d-9963-9f7b693cf08c-1
00:39:20.841 --> 00:39:22.120
put you put you in?

dcf9fc06-a6d9-4273-b5f9-306ff40ac239-0
00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:26.833
And should we adopt that more,
if for no other reason just because it it

dcf9fc06-a6d9-4273-b5f9-306ff40ac239-1
00:39:26.833 --> 00:39:28.880
puts us in a in a better position?

253cd082-5dc9-4179-b8b6-7062b120b216-0
00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:35.720
Yeah, in, in Canada,
I know that radial access has actually

253cd082-5dc9-4179-b8b6-7062b120b216-1
00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:38.600
been adopted quite early actually.

66dea8e6-3f58-48a1-8d17-438491922620-0
00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:40.870
You know, Victoria,
the group out there was one of the

66dea8e6-3f58-48a1-8d17-438491922620-1
00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:43.720
earliest ones in the early 2000s to
really push the radial approach.

f86ea7b2-ee41-47ae-817a-e1847b60c220-0
00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:48.120
And most centers in Canada are about 95%,
I would say primarily radial.

8c3cb134-27e3-4c26-8fc7-d88e6616fac5-0
00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:54.630
I think it's there's a lot of benefits to
not just a patient in terms of vascular

8c3cb134-27e3-4c26-8fc7-d88e6616fac5-1
00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:57.040
access complications,
but even to operators.

dd7cdba6-dfba-4c0c-9e13-a280bed5a518-0
00:39:57.040 --> 00:40:01.840
It's the easiest access I would say or
easiest, I guess access.

15b81960-8a77-4f5f-ba7a-2c22e20030b3-0
00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:05.760
Once you have your catheter in position,
it's just right in front of you.

4dca9115-b477-461b-9e09-e1562aa57a0c-0
00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:09.440
There's no reaching across femorals,
which makes it quite favorable,

4dca9115-b477-461b-9e09-e1562aa57a0c-1
00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:11.786
provided you have the, I guess,
experience,

4dca9115-b477-461b-9e09-e1562aa57a0c-2
00:40:11.786 --> 00:40:14.400
you know how to position catheters and
all that.

6bb2dcb6-94cf-403e-9694-8d634bdf79e7-0
00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:19.878
The one area that becomes I think even
through my training of what 12 years ago

6bb2dcb6-94cf-403e-9694-8d634bdf79e7-1
00:40:19.878 --> 00:40:24.480
or so was the left radial that shows just
kind of increase over time as well.

f1dcd6a6-1970-4ac9-9535-9d2db3e85e8f-0
00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:29.681
So particularly patients with either poor
right radial access or who have a Lima

f1dcd6a6-1970-4ac9-9535-9d2db3e85e8f-1
00:40:29.681 --> 00:40:33.020
post cabbage,
we just tend to go left radial and it

f1dcd6a6-1970-4ac9-9535-9d2db3e85e8f-2
00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:36.359
gives us access to the Lima pretty easily
actually.

a6e6deb1-dcf4-4575-971e-115cbc2be3e9-0
00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:39.120
And then easier than going femoral quad
usually.

58e1784c-68f5-474a-bcdb-2e51b6d207c9-0
00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:43.286
And then you can get pretty much all your,
your pictures and we do the PCI from that

58e1784c-68f5-474a-bcdb-2e51b6d207c9-1
00:40:43.286 --> 00:40:43.920
route as well.

4efc7dd1-c533-42d2-a1ad-49a5412b72ea-0
00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:49.252
The issue is without proper support,
the left reel can be a real pain in the

4efc7dd1-c533-42d2-a1ad-49a5412b72ea-1
00:40:49.252 --> 00:40:50.400
back if you're not.

07a5f645-ced8-4554-a92c-2f687bd20de5-0
00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:54.577
And we started out with, you know,
just kind of clipping the patient's arm

07a5f645-ced8-4554-a92c-2f687bd20de5-1
00:40:54.577 --> 00:40:55.320
to the drapes.

b0538341-74b1-47dd-bdee-fef5ea8111f8-0
00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:57.160
Of course,
the drapes are not being held by anything.

c7a23644-d9bd-4544-91a1-c5ac983cdcc4-0
00:40:57.160 --> 00:41:00.968
And by the time you're kind of doing your
PCI and pushing your guide to get better

c7a23644-d9bd-4544-91a1-c5ac983cdcc4-1
00:41:00.968 --> 00:41:03.080
support,
patient's arm ends up at their side.

6aaa49a3-f5b9-46bf-ae97-c5af3cf5d7d3-0
00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:05.040
Now you're reaching all the way across
the patient.

b1d56eb6-ef6b-457b-bd0a-bc47826b0b02-0
00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:07.680
If it's a larger patient,
it's a real pain.

7f8579c8-9c4f-491e-ba0e-f9b10f53c012-0
00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:11.893
So that, that's kind of for me why the,
the support for left radial especially

7f8579c8-9c4f-491e-ba0e-f9b10f53c012-1
00:41:11.893 --> 00:41:13.120
makes a big difference.

4c6098a2-1f0c-417f-9392-9fb9ae1d0c19-0
00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:16.915
And in our lab with the equipment that we
have, it's, it's like no,

4c6098a2-1f0c-417f-9392-9fb9ae1d0c19-1
00:41:16.915 --> 00:41:17.920
no problem at all.

b8f8d384-adfd-457c-a77a-93d1b074d089-0
00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:20.809
The way it works with the Armory just
kind of peeks out under,

b8f8d384-adfd-457c-a77a-93d1b074d089-1
00:41:20.809 --> 00:41:24.433
I'd say right around kind of midline
between the females where the left radial

b8f8d384-adfd-457c-a77a-93d1b074d089-2
00:41:24.433 --> 00:41:24.800
ends up.

7f5aa51c-9f32-4596-92e1-791737bf21fd-0
00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:27.707
So it's been a huge,
I'd say advancement since we started

7f5aa51c-9f32-4596-92e1-791737bf21fd-1
00:41:27.707 --> 00:41:28.760
doing that in Canada.

0166d47b-b63f-4d91-81b6-8158193a4eff-0
00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:31.400
Great, fantastic.

b5edd0b8-e50e-4557-9695-45c78bd7b22f-0
00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:33.920
Doctor Howson,
I'm sure you have some questions too.

3f092e2d-7abf-4226-a5a5-f365d22087ae-0
00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:38.715
Yeah, I mean,
Doctor Harrison kind of just touched upon

3f092e2d-7abf-4226-a5a5-f365d22087ae-1
00:41:38.715 --> 00:41:44.126
that because I was going to say in terms
of exercises for women in particular,

3f092e2d-7abf-4226-a5a5-f365d22087ae-2
00:41:44.126 --> 00:41:47.551
postural correction prior to anything is
crucial,

3f092e2d-7abf-4226-a5a5-f365d22087ae-3
00:41:47.551 --> 00:41:49.879
but you've already mentioned that.

975fd7e2-d20e-4074-94b1-bdc62b079e36-0
00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:53.659
Is there anything, I mean,
you've helped me personally over the

975fd7e2-d20e-4074-94b1-bdc62b079e36-1
00:41:53.659 --> 00:41:56.120
years,
but is there anything because I mean,

975fd7e2-d20e-4074-94b1-bdc62b079e36-2
00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:58.963
a lot of the departments,
this is not being sexist,

975fd7e2-d20e-4074-94b1-bdc62b079e36-3
00:41:58.963 --> 00:42:02.354
but just in general,
a lot of the radiographers are female in

975fd7e2-d20e-4074-94b1-bdc62b079e36-4
00:42:02.354 --> 00:42:04.760
in my trust and most of the trusts were
of.

e2c27365-0d13-4e7b-bc81-6f56c123c283-0
00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:10.311
So this is a huge population that is
obviously just naturally because of

e2c27365-0d13-4e7b-bc81-6f56c123c283-1
00:42:10.311 --> 00:42:16.232
hormones and pregnancy and change to the
anatomy that posture is heavily affected

e2c27365-0d13-4e7b-bc81-6f56c123c283-2
00:42:16.232 --> 00:42:21.720
and then hitting the hormones of
menopause and premenopause, it's affected.

4d90d9a9-43f4-485f-bd23-7b518438786b-0
00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:27.046
Is there anything that you would
recommend for this group more than any of

4d90d9a9-43f4-485f-bd23-7b518438786b-1
00:42:27.046 --> 00:42:28.200
the other groups?

aae3448d-d776-4265-a544-76f41437bcac-0
00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:32.676
Would you say that maybe just focus on
postural is enough or postural and

aae3448d-d776-4265-a544-76f41437bcac-1
00:42:32.676 --> 00:42:33.160
weights?

f640bb6a-4d95-4136-8906-70c1389d52ad-0
00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:38.112
I know for me you've said the combination,
but I just wondered in general,

f640bb6a-4d95-4136-8906-70c1389d52ad-1
00:42:38.112 --> 00:42:41.120
would that be the best advice for
everybody else?

fedaee79-fb19-4a95-8782-3f25f4dfb59d-0
00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:47.474
I think when it comes to differences
between males and females,

fedaee79-fb19-4a95-8782-3f25f4dfb59d-1
00:42:47.474 --> 00:42:52.769
I don't actually think that is what as
far as I know,

fedaee79-fb19-4a95-8782-3f25f4dfb59d-2
00:42:52.769 --> 00:43:00.710
I've been studying the the this postural
training staying quite a lot and and as

fedaee79-fb19-4a95-8782-3f25f4dfb59d-3
00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:06.103
far as I know,
they don't recommend any differences in

fedaee79-fb19-4a95-8782-3f25f4dfb59d-4
00:43:06.103 --> 00:43:07.280
in approach.

d5213140-3e2b-4b40-bc85-00ef0f627e81-0
00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:13.732
It all comes down to to comes down to
what kind of compensations you you are

d5213140-3e2b-4b40-bc85-00ef0f627e81-1
00:43:13.732 --> 00:43:16.680
you are demonstrating in your posture.

6d570d2a-77be-49e5-9337-c064a5ce4393-0
00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:20.518
For example,
if you have I think for for females,

6d570d2a-77be-49e5-9337-c064a5ce4393-1
00:43:20.518 --> 00:43:24.197
perhaps they perhaps they can get the
more you know, it's,

6d570d2a-77be-49e5-9337-c064a5ce4393-2
00:43:24.197 --> 00:43:29.000
it's it's more it's more common among
women to have an anterior pelvic tilt.

5865fd35-6572-4e77-8a48-0831fd6f17d4-0
00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.440
You know, the pelvis is is is pointed.

dc3b6074-f6f5-4bad-a24b-bd034e73550e-0
00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:35.547
So you get a more,
a larger lumbar called curvature like

dc3b6074-f6f5-4bad-a24b-bd034e73550e-1
00:43:35.547 --> 00:43:35.880
this.

bccc3844-1185-49dc-b95b-29b1aca49f54-0
00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:39.315
It's more,
it's more common in women and that can

bccc3844-1185-49dc-b95b-29b1aca49f54-1
00:43:39.315 --> 00:43:44.194
cause problems both downstream and
upstream when it comes to slouching

bccc3844-1185-49dc-b95b-29b1aca49f54-2
00:43:44.194 --> 00:43:49.692
shoulders or, or knees that are, you know,
less internal rotation of the of the

bccc3844-1185-49dc-b95b-29b1aca49f54-3
00:43:49.692 --> 00:43:51.960
femur can leads to knee problems.

aff99f2d-d7ad-486a-935e-5f1c515411a5-0
00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:55.407
Women also have a,
a greater Q angle in their,

aff99f2d-d7ad-486a-935e-5f1c515411a5-1
00:43:55.407 --> 00:43:59.238
in their knees, you know,
so all these things combined can lead to

aff99f2d-d7ad-486a-935e-5f1c515411a5-2
00:43:59.238 --> 00:44:01.640
a series of all the compensatory problems.

1edbbfa4-25a8-4dd0-8049-da166b24d683-0
00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:09.019
But I think what it all boils down to
addressing the 'cause you know, and, and,

1edbbfa4-25a8-4dd0-8049-da166b24d683-1
00:44:09.019 --> 00:44:15.459
and taking appropriate measures to,
to fight these compensations, you know,

1edbbfa4-25a8-4dd0-8049-da166b24d683-2
00:44:15.459 --> 00:44:22.493
so, so I don't think there is actually,
men can also demonstrate this kind of, of,

1edbbfa4-25a8-4dd0-8049-da166b24d683-3
00:44:22.493 --> 00:44:25.120
of, of, of postural imbalances.

04a6913a-b2dc-450a-87ab-a768a92c4846-0
00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:29.078
So I don't think there is actually a
difference between women and men in that

04a6913a-b2dc-450a-87ab-a768a92c4846-1
00:44:29.078 --> 00:44:29.840
in that regard.

4364c4b7-e7cb-4e2d-9e4d-3514245f3a61-0
00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:32.040
Thank you.

c912dbdc-ce33-461b-9339-908af58e6b25-0
00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:37.613
I know that when I'm in the lab,
it seems like just as day goes on,

c912dbdc-ce33-461b-9339-908af58e6b25-1
00:44:37.613 --> 00:44:39.160
I just kind of start bending over.

6a25fb9b-99d4-471d-b769-90bed91e5ebe-0
00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:41.760
My posture gets worse, worse and worse.

f8169ccf-42c1-40e5-a1ee-0b311c61f3e8-0
00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:44.920
And I think, you know,
it's some of the pictures that Doctor

f8169ccf-42c1-40e5-a1ee-0b311c61f3e8-1
00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:45.600
Kocher showed.

3ef38526-a8f0-472c-9e99-9d78f694dc61-0
00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:50.163
We're putting ourselves in some terrible,
you know, ergonomic,

3ef38526-a8f0-472c-9e99-9d78f694dc61-1
00:44:50.163 --> 00:44:54.743
ergonomic positions with that, you know,
reaching and twisting and,

3ef38526-a8f0-472c-9e99-9d78f694dc61-2
00:44:54.743 --> 00:44:56.359
and turning and flexing.

174164c5-f1a8-4fb9-8ac4-71901f601efa-0
00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:59.771
And,
and so I do think that that's something

174164c5-f1a8-4fb9-8ac4-71901f601efa-1
00:44:59.771 --> 00:45:04.925
that that we have to, you know,
we certainly have to address fairly

174164c5-f1a8-4fb9-8ac4-71901f601efa-2
00:45:04.925 --> 00:45:10.762
quickly because unfortunately we are
seeing few juniors presenting with disc

174164c5-f1a8-4fb9-8ac4-71901f601efa-3
00:45:10.762 --> 00:45:11.520
prolapses.

f1e420d1-dcda-467c-a879-d9c0642f9b5c-0
00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:14.827
Now whilst there's a variety of why it
may happen,

f1e420d1-dcda-467c-a879-d9c0642f9b5c-1
00:45:14.827 --> 00:45:19.573
the fact that they happen to be wearing
lead is something that is of great

f1e420d1-dcda-467c-a879-d9c0642f9b5c-2
00:45:19.573 --> 00:45:20.080
concern.

da993582-2cc6-4e78-80ee-db4f4e0f9624-0
00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:24.811
So anything that can help,
whether it's exercises, strengthening,

da993582-2cc6-4e78-80ee-db4f4e0f9624-1
00:45:24.811 --> 00:45:29.400
posture correction or just being with
minimal lead, the better.

ae5e6adb-a882-403d-a9a1-e2da26a32e4b-0
00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:31.720
But I think it's it's it's really
important.

e789325c-9cbc-4805-a255-969313691dab-0
00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:33.600
And the more data that we have,
the better.

e805c112-18b4-4e80-a5bd-a98b32f34e13-0
00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:35.760
I just bring it up.

b9d6588f-1702-4722-95ff-e643de0f2092-0
00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:36.200
Yeah, sorry.

f972c62e-b02b-4f9b-b9b2-cdcc08031acb-0
00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:41.476
So I was going to bring up one very small,
but I think important point that I've

f972c62e-b02b-4f9b-b9b2-cdcc08031acb-1
00:45:41.476 --> 00:45:46.173
noticed myself using the foot pedals for
those of us who actually step on the

f972c62e-b02b-4f9b-b9b2-cdcc08031acb-2
00:45:46.173 --> 00:45:49.604
floor ourselves,
you tend to end up with a favorite foot

f972c62e-b02b-4f9b-b9b2-cdcc08031acb-3
00:45:49.604 --> 00:45:54.000
and I think you end up leaning one way
quite heavily throughout all day.

1a9d19d5-ffc9-44af-9dfb-8c51e8143900-0
00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:57.647
And so I try to just alternate the foot
that I use small point that I think kind

1a9d19d5-ffc9-44af-9dfb-8c51e8143900-1
00:45:57.647 --> 00:46:00.400
of helps to balance the tilt and the
pelvis you might end up with.

1d3f01bb-bd15-4651-8be1-b07d502d3fa2-0
00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:02.560
That's a very good suggestion.

77785dab-3729-45e3-9efb-fd9bc5b6d66b-0
00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:05.160
I do actually exactly the same.

5895fc13-78ad-4210-bb4f-dd4111825aca-0
00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:07.320
You know,
you alter from left to right all the time.

5aaeb53c-8db7-4188-8e8c-d9ba8a202d04-0
00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:11.946
And I think it,
you have to be aware of your, how you,

5aaeb53c-8db7-4188-8e8c-d9ba8a202d04-1
00:46:11.946 --> 00:46:13.040
how you move.

ab2296e0-85e7-4b92-a0df-6341715bed9f-0
00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:17.200
You know, you have to be aware on your,
where you have your, your weight.

b5f15b32-5b69-45e3-86f3-0e5a2a06b886-0
00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:18.520
Now my weight is on the left.

ae2447d9-398a-4fb9-b9a9-e76421f71b57-0
00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:21.920
Now my weight is on the right now my neck
is forward.

d1f58e66-2514-4dff-a24c-4efb54c51fc3-0
00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:25.374
Now my, you know,
it's small things that you can actually

d1f58e66-2514-4dff-a24c-4efb54c51fc3-1
00:46:25.374 --> 00:46:27.400
be aware of during your procedure.

8aec61c5-f1a9-4ab9-adf0-f3ffbaff7b16-0
00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:31.797
And after a while it becomes second
nature If you just pay attention to it

8aec61c5-f1a9-4ab9-adf0-f3ffbaff7b16-1
00:46:31.797 --> 00:46:33.320
and, and, and focus on that.

38f138aa-c0b2-4ca7-8a20-972059007fad-0
00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:38.645
It's not so difficult actually to, to,
to just take a take a moment and how am I

38f138aa-c0b2-4ca7-8a20-972059007fad-1
00:46:38.645 --> 00:46:40.320
actually standing right now?

d024e4e1-95fd-4b60-8f2e-0e134378ff65-0
00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:43.600
How is, how is my posture right now?

c8c927c9-9cb1-4b01-a28f-0e1192c32f9f-0
00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:47.414
I mean, I, you know, the, the, the,
the horror image that the,

c8c927c9-9cb1-4b01-a28f-0e1192c32f9f-1
00:46:47.414 --> 00:46:52.268
that the doctor culture showed, You know,
when you're well twisted and of course

c8c927c9-9cb1-4b01-a28f-0e1192c32f9f-2
00:46:52.268 --> 00:46:56.881
you don't need to be a, a doctor to,
or a physical therapist to realize that

c8c927c9-9cb1-4b01-a28f-0e1192c32f9f-3
00:46:56.881 --> 00:46:58.080
that is not healthy.

3e283398-d075-4050-95c8-7807744b92ad-0
00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:03.240
You know, it's, it's, it's like,
it's crazy to be mindful.

11c9d262-4cd0-4cec-b0d0-d3033c7d3be4-0
00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:05.545
I think of your of your, how you're,
how you,

11c9d262-4cd0-4cec-b0d0-d3033c7d3be4-1
00:47:05.545 --> 00:47:07.400
how you move and how you're standing.

c16c015d-c0bc-4961-953e-fa5c2cb8d5cd-0
00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:09.560
Very good.

b4e49596-2f10-4af2-8ad7-ac9f10d142a3-0
00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:11.280
Doctor Kocher, you're on.

8453d21a-d9f2-417c-b9b2-c721baaa7a26-0
00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:13.800
Did you have a question?

d255e8fb-e0c0-40ff-bea2-9593bb456c5e-0
00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:14.840
Your hand was up.

24333dc6-3107-4d0d-ab8b-88b8b974b83f-0
00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:16.720
Can you hear me?

01eba405-bec1-4b4b-84d0-4a68fdf4fd91-0
00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:20.680
I don't know if he can hear me or not.

643f626b-50de-4d1d-a89c-cc3978bad0d4-0
00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:23.440
Yeah.

6a5e4ef0-0ba6-4655-a869-ff484cc03e9a-0
00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:23.800
Can I?

2e050bf4-cfba-48c2-a372-e13615205d24-0
00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:24.800
Yeah.

479942f7-7abc-4037-9499-f425cce9b240-0
00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:25.160
Sorry.

8deb4bc4-0631-4faa-8e5a-94f854608d48-0
00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:26.680
Yeah.

b8422946-8947-4e10-9792-ab042233e6c4-0
00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:27.600
I just wanted to build.

c5c99bbb-c684-4828-8c96-085ccc5f85de-0
00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:30.960
Yeah.

0db8e398-dcb6-45e0-b09d-6d704c15302c-0
00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:32.160
I think he's having some Internet.

0c8615a4-8288-4efd-90f4-780f8e3a76c9-0
00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:36.819
Internet issues,
one of the things that had kind of come

0c8615a4-8288-4efd-90f4-780f8e3a76c9-1
00:47:36.819 --> 00:47:40.166
up in some of the other sessions is
reporting,

0c8615a4-8288-4efd-90f4-780f8e3a76c9-2
00:47:40.166 --> 00:47:44.582
reporting injuries and and if we have
these kind of injuries,

0c8615a4-8288-4efd-90f4-780f8e3a76c9-3
00:47:44.582 --> 00:47:48.926
is there is there really a way to to
report these to get it,

0c8615a4-8288-4efd-90f4-780f8e3a76c9-4
00:47:48.926 --> 00:47:50.280
to get a good idea?

9e244bcf-a076-4b7f-93bf-9fa766950cca-0
00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:54.223
Are they really,
we have surveys and obviously the surveys

9e244bcf-a076-4b7f-93bf-9fa766950cca-1
00:47:54.223 --> 00:47:58.969
have been based on a lot of surveys have
been done, but, but you know,

9e244bcf-a076-4b7f-93bf-9fa766950cca-2
00:47:58.969 --> 00:48:03.314
do we really have a way of knowing what
is the true injury rate,

9e244bcf-a076-4b7f-93bf-9fa766950cca-3
00:48:03.314 --> 00:48:08.260
both with from or cataracts and,
and musculoskeletal to really get a good

9e244bcf-a076-4b7f-93bf-9fa766950cca-4
00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:11.603
grasp of are we under reporting or, or,
you know,

9e244bcf-a076-4b7f-93bf-9fa766950cca-5
00:48:11.603 --> 00:48:16.683
are we reporting it just based on,
on pain and fatigue, which obviously is,

9e244bcf-a076-4b7f-93bf-9fa766950cca-6
00:48:16.683 --> 00:48:19.824
is a,
is a signal that maybe something's going

9e244bcf-a076-4b7f-93bf-9fa766950cca-7
00:48:19.824 --> 00:48:20.560
on as well.

b09002ba-98d8-4d39-8fba-6df533ad57f5-0
00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:24.841
While,
while I have an access here to chat with

b09002ba-98d8-4d39-8fba-6df533ad57f5-1
00:48:24.841 --> 00:48:28.407
you guys,
it sounds like the MGB Internet is,

b09002ba-98d8-4d39-8fba-6df533ad57f5-2
00:48:28.407 --> 00:48:29.880
is failing me here.

1eb9e7e1-9cab-4ebe-9576-898fc79d93ba-0
00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:32.405
But really quickly,
can I just say a couple,

1eb9e7e1-9cab-4ebe-9576-898fc79d93ba-1
00:48:32.405 --> 00:48:33.640
a couple quick points.

b9ca28fd-d012-48f3-9b1d-c4292bdea8be-0
00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:36.429
If,
if people didn't get anything else from

b9ca28fd-d012-48f3-9b1d-c4292bdea8be-1
00:48:36.429 --> 00:48:39.662
ergo Cath,
sort of the key message was that 34% of

b9ca28fd-d012-48f3-9b1d-c4292bdea8be-2
00:48:39.662 --> 00:48:43.720
total case duration was spent in a high
risk cervical position.

00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:47.760
But specifically that was in the axial
rotation plane.

9e4eb4fb-d25d-4847-9dff-085995a30aef-0
00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:49.560
And so I've been thinking a lot about
that.

abbfa64c-aaa0-434c-b97f-6f1666e79f22-0
00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:53.145
For those of us who work in the Cath lab,
you'll know,

abbfa64c-aaa0-434c-b97f-6f1666e79f22-1
00:48:53.145 --> 00:48:58.195
and I'm sure this is a similar in IR and
other suites, we generate a ton of waste,

abbfa64c-aaa0-434c-b97f-6f1666e79f22-2
00:48:58.195 --> 00:48:58.560
right?

058cb377-ce3a-4d33-9882-f5885d4eadc9-0
00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:01.721
Every balloon that you get,
you've got a stilette,

058cb377-ce3a-4d33-9882-f5885d4eadc9-1
00:49:01.721 --> 00:49:05.120
you've got a compliance chart,
and then you've got the hoop.

bef869cb-6792-4afb-b243-a11d8bd08b37-0
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:09.880
And at least what I've been doing was
turning around to throw it away.

b33ac982-3871-48f9-85f3-ebed24a19db5-0
00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:14.520
And so one of the opportunities I think
we have is to redesign Cath labs.

6fbb6471-63f4-4164-85c6-0606385b27d5-0
00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:18.609
So for example,
I'm putting the trash in front of me now

6fbb6471-63f4-4164-85c6-0606385b27d5-1
00:49:18.609 --> 00:49:23.554
so that I'm throwing the trash out in
front as opposed to sort of turning

6fbb6471-63f4-4164-85c6-0606385b27d5-2
00:49:23.554 --> 00:49:25.960
around every time I need to do that.

05c76014-183f-4c54-bbc5-e50c7739713a-0
00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:31.126
And then the second point to your comment
about measuring,

05c76014-183f-4c54-bbc5-e50c7739713a-1
00:49:31.126 --> 00:49:37.162
measuring the overall rate, look,
the institution's never going to love you

05c76014-183f-4c54-bbc5-e50c7739713a-2
00:49:37.162 --> 00:49:37.560
back.

978aafaf-dd1b-4467-82fb-23944a9219a0-0
00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:42.825
And so I think at a societal level,
we're going to have to mandate actually

978aafaf-dd1b-4467-82fb-23944a9219a0-1
00:49:42.825 --> 00:49:44.280
obtaining these data.

a2a0618e-b415-42fe-9f2e-7b7ce83d6081-0
00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:49.480
And that's the only way that we're going
to really get the the true rates.

159ef500-c18b-4648-8779-bce039681b95-0
00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:55.600
Even the sky survey from 2023 was only an
8% response rate, so not very high there.

e0378bb5-f437-43ce-bf7e-0130160bdcbb-0
00:49:57.680 --> 00:49:58.360
That's a good point.

60955834-87ab-482b-8e4f-7528e3004994-0
00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:03.857
There are some and,
and anybody can kind of weigh on weigh in

60955834-87ab-482b-8e4f-7528e3004994-1
00:50:03.857 --> 00:50:08.329
on this because I don't know the answer,
but some, some want to say, well,

60955834-87ab-482b-8e4f-7528e3004994-2
00:50:08.329 --> 00:50:12.443
you know, how are we ever,
when are we going to know that any of any

60955834-87ab-482b-8e4f-7528e3004994-3
00:50:12.443 --> 00:50:16.140
of these changes that,
that have improved the ergonomics that

60955834-87ab-482b-8e4f-7528e3004994-4
00:50:16.140 --> 00:50:20.016
we're actually improving the the risk and
actually lowering the,

60955834-87ab-482b-8e4f-7528e3004994-5
00:50:20.016 --> 00:50:24.787
the disease process and lowering your
risk for cancer because they're not being

60955834-87ab-482b-8e4f-7528e3004994-6
00:50:24.787 --> 00:50:25.919
reported very well.

9b313890-9727-4f49-bede-a8817418098e-0
00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:29.737
So it's hard to know whether or not any
of these are really having much of an

9b313890-9727-4f49-bede-a8817418098e-1
00:50:29.737 --> 00:50:30.080
impact.

4927b26a-663e-4503-a8da-a2d9c960cd41-0
00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:32.568
And there's some, you know,
there's some people say,

4927b26a-663e-4503-a8da-a2d9c960cd41-1
00:50:32.568 --> 00:50:35.113
I'm not going to adopt anything until I
have, you know,

4927b26a-663e-4503-a8da-a2d9c960cd41-2
00:50:35.113 --> 00:50:37.840
10 year data to show that actually
reduces your, your risk.

4fdc4469-1c13-457f-9de8-c2fd11a7943a-0
00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:40.120
And, and we don't have that data.

afa33b06-329b-43ed-9151-caf7b07253d6-0
00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:43.163
You know,
we know we have signs and and we know

afa33b06-329b-43ed-9151-caf7b07253d6-1
00:50:43.163 --> 00:50:47.581
that from some of the work that Doctor
Kocher has done that that we're putting

afa33b06-329b-43ed-9151-caf7b07253d6-2
00:50:47.581 --> 00:50:51.160
ourselves in these really high flexion
and high risk positions.

6f6e6643-87bc-4dbb-91a4-9ef5a6882d4a-0
00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:55.996
And so I think we just have to right now
do everything that we can to reduce it,

6f6e6643-87bc-4dbb-91a4-9ef5a6882d4a-1
00:50:55.996 --> 00:50:58.802
But it's not going to take the risk,
you know,

6f6e6643-87bc-4dbb-91a4-9ef5a6882d4a-2
00:50:58.802 --> 00:51:03.340
certainly not going to take the risk to 0,
but, but we've got to, you know,

6f6e6643-87bc-4dbb-91a4-9ef5a6882d4a-3
00:51:03.340 --> 00:51:06.803
we've got to, to me,
certainly from radiation standpoint,

6f6e6643-87bc-4dbb-91a4-9ef5a6882d4a-4
00:51:06.803 --> 00:51:11.221
take that down as low as what's
achievable with the technologies that you

6f6e6643-87bc-4dbb-91a4-9ef5a6882d4a-5
00:51:11.221 --> 00:51:11.519
have.

cf61c19c-808b-4af2-ae88-aa593b15506e-0
00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:13.809
And,
and with these new systems and sea arms

cf61c19c-808b-4af2-ae88-aa593b15506e-1
00:51:13.809 --> 00:51:16.862
and things like that,
that are really driving the amount of

cf61c19c-808b-4af2-ae88-aa593b15506e-2
00:51:16.862 --> 00:51:17.880
radiation producing.

ac4bb9b3-bdfd-41ba-a28c-4d30e9f06bf6-0
00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:21.476
And, and you know, there's quite a few,
particularly EP that's getting to the

ac4bb9b3-bdfd-41ba-a28c-4d30e9f06bf6-1
00:51:21.476 --> 00:51:23.920
point that a lot of their procedures are
X-ray free.

09e57580-e459-4e85-90a1-9423622ebf81-0
00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:26.960
So, so again,
I think all those technologies and

09e57580-e459-4e85-90a1-9423622ebf81-1
00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:30.033
combined together,
I think we're going to get to a point

09e57580-e459-4e85-90a1-9423622ebf81-2
00:51:30.033 --> 00:51:34.021
that they can really, you know,
put us in a lot safer place and hopefully

09e57580-e459-4e85-90a1-9423622ebf81-3
00:51:34.021 --> 00:51:35.800
recruit more people in our field.

5a79865b-0df0-4c38-ba36-50fc4ef62a32-0
00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:39.509
Because I don't know what it's like in
Canada and Sweden in the UK,

5a79865b-0df0-4c38-ba36-50fc4ef62a32-1
00:51:39.509 --> 00:51:43.054
But but but here in the US,
there's a massive shortage of people

5a79865b-0df0-4c38-ba36-50fc4ef62a32-2
00:51:43.054 --> 00:51:45.999
going into going into cardiology,
particularly women.

7fea9db5-36a4-4d9a-a8fe-56bde5d65964-0
00:51:47.160 --> 00:51:52.158
I think the biggest point is,
is to realize when you have a full day

7fea9db5-36a4-4d9a-a8fe-56bde5d65964-1
00:51:52.158 --> 00:51:56.142
shift and you've been in LED doing
various procedures,

7fea9db5-36a4-4d9a-a8fe-56bde5d65964-2
00:51:56.142 --> 00:52:02.082
I doubt many people leave at the end of
the day feeling great or amazing or Oh my

7fea9db5-36a4-4d9a-a8fe-56bde5d65964-3
00:52:02.082 --> 00:52:04.400
God, I feel my back is so great.

9ce9f0a3-4188-4c99-9a70-079166448dbf-0
00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:05.960
I think I can run a marathon.

6839b4f3-5b85-493c-aa68-6b2f8a8abce1-0
00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:09.210
The reality is by the time you finished
your day shift,

6839b4f3-5b85-493c-aa68-6b2f8a8abce1-1
00:52:09.210 --> 00:52:13.272
even if they were simple procedures and
nothing complicated going on,

6839b4f3-5b85-493c-aa68-6b2f8a8abce1-2
00:52:13.272 --> 00:52:17.800
I think the majority of us can put our
hands up and say we do not feel great.

f9c420f9-cc0b-4ef9-843c-5449b36eeb2d-0
00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:20.800
Apart from Doctor Erickson,
we don't feel that great.

a5794ae8-0b6b-4d25-84b3-08319ffb8703-0
00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:24.693
You know, there's something aching,
there's a twitch,

a5794ae8-0b6b-4d25-84b3-08319ffb8703-1
00:52:24.693 --> 00:52:29.810
or you're always like the number of
people we have that we're doing this,

a5794ae8-0b6b-4d25-84b3-08319ffb8703-2
00:52:29.810 --> 00:52:30.640
it's common.

c9280f21-d933-4d25-93c5-d94885a89b15-0
00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:34.640
So I think that alone,
forget the things we don't see or feel.

4dab52f6-e6d8-44f7-afc9-68140d2dd9f0-0
00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:37.760
That definitely suggests we need to
change.

705b7f8a-f73d-4149-a01f-ce2a50644e52-0
00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:39.440
We need to do something.

7684ee5e-bdf4-46f9-baad-511135e2f3ba-0
00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:43.280
I I would say two couple things.

6b26dd82-3968-4856-ab09-613cf652655e-0
00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:46.164
You know this when we were looking to to
do ergo Cath,

6b26dd82-3968-4856-ab09-613cf652655e-1
00:52:46.164 --> 00:52:48.840
we were looking to actually measure sleep
as well.

fbd2083a-9611-4ab4-b130-7b15cd6467da-0
00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:53.014
And I don't know if this has been
mentioned at all as as I've been coming

fbd2083a-9611-4ab4-b130-7b15cd6467da-1
00:52:53.014 --> 00:52:55.722
in and out,
but I think high quality sleep is a

fbd2083a-9611-4ab4-b130-7b15cd6467da-2
00:52:55.722 --> 00:52:57.640
really important part of recovery.

99f57dc4-21ab-45b4-8c25-dfad46257c3f-0
00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:01.727
And and then borrowing concepts from
actually our * athletes,

99f57dc4-21ab-45b4-8c25-dfad46257c3f-1
00:53:01.727 --> 00:53:06.237
which I think many of you all are in,
in your own sort of ways is thinking

99f57dc4-21ab-45b4-8c25-dfad46257c3f-2
00:53:06.237 --> 00:53:07.560
about load management.

a8594098-fe70-4701-8d60-e6b4446a4ded-0
00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:12.648
I think it's particularly tricky in the
US they in an environment where Medicare

a8594098-fe70-4701-8d60-e6b4446a4ded-1
00:53:12.648 --> 00:53:17.657
reimbursement is dropping and so there's
a ton of pressure to do more cases more

a8594098-fe70-4701-8d60-e6b4446a4ded-2
00:53:17.657 --> 00:53:18.400
efficiently.

7a663bf4-1860-470b-b03e-a999e11b5018-0
00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:23.790
But I think from a look of longevity,
you know, you're doing a,

7a663bf4-1860-470b-b03e-a999e11b5018-1
00:53:23.790 --> 00:53:27.214
a six hour CTO after you've been up doing
a,

7a663bf4-1860-470b-b03e-a999e11b5018-2
00:53:27.214 --> 00:53:33.454
a STEMI with shock probably results in a
lot of micro trauma that over the course

7a663bf4-1860-470b-b03e-a999e11b5018-3
00:53:33.454 --> 00:53:39.618
of a career really accumulates into to
major injuries that we've seen in many of

7a663bf4-1860-470b-b03e-a999e11b5018-4
00:53:39.618 --> 00:53:40.759
our colleagues.

655aa8f6-cdaa-4495-bb68-7d590c56b3ee-0
00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:45.520
And so I think 2 concepts being really
prioritizing high quality sleep.

aae8cb3b-0c85-45c3-8411-f6d84ea34475-0
00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:51.771
And then second is sort of some thought
about load management on top of a forget

aae8cb3b-0c85-45c3-8411-f6d84ea34475-1
00:53:51.771 --> 00:53:54.866
if I,
I don't know if I had lobbed off their

aae8cb3b-0c85-45c3-8411-f6d84ea34475-2
00:53:54.866 --> 00:53:59.199
previously, but the,
the concept I was trying to allude to was

aae8cb3b-0c85-45c3-8411-f6d84ea34475-3
00:53:59.199 --> 00:54:04.908
redesigning Cath labs to be specifically
oriented to being more beneficial towards

aae8cb3b-0c85-45c3-8411-f6d84ea34475-4
00:54:04.908 --> 00:54:08.760
optimizing ergonomics for, for,
for Cath lab operators.

cda30e24-977d-440a-be46-56a79e011bc9-0
00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:11.216
And,
and specifically what I was saying there

cda30e24-977d-440a-be46-56a79e011bc9-1
00:54:11.216 --> 00:54:14.366
is that, for example,
very simple shift that we've made is

cda30e24-977d-440a-be46-56a79e011bc9-2
00:54:14.366 --> 00:54:18.638
actually have the trash can in front of
us so that we're not rotating to throw,

cda30e24-977d-440a-be46-56a79e011bc9-3
00:54:18.638 --> 00:54:20.080
throw things out behind us.

87b9eb51-928f-44cb-8902-a7c749f0210a-0
00:54:21.440 --> 00:54:23.160
I'm so glad you mentioned sleep.

d3ae86fd-0f41-4356-b705-125356e18c65-0
00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:28.016
So we had before in the prior talks about
inflammation and impact of inflammation

d3ae86fd-0f41-4356-b705-125356e18c65-1
00:54:28.016 --> 00:54:29.320
on healing and damage.

8f3b3b33-3d25-457f-9ca8-ab83e92a4676-0
00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:34.996
Now sleep and cortisol are major things
and I think we downplay it and I'm glad

8f3b3b33-3d25-457f-9ca8-ab83e92a4676-1
00:54:34.996 --> 00:54:38.229
that things are changing because in my
training,

8f3b3b33-3d25-457f-9ca8-ab83e92a4676-2
00:54:38.229 --> 00:54:43.440
certainly you were almost high 5 for not
sleeping and doing 7 nights in a row.

351c8a45-ac69-4eae-b184-797c2ad624ff-0
00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:44.760
Oh you're such a hero.

aee42502-2f38-4573-a729-b365ffe9b7f2-0
00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:47.040
But actually that is not hero at all.

bbb5d18f-4263-4187-9812-81705c056f35-0
00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:52.308
Whilst we all require different number of
hours of sleep, like I need 10,

bbb5d18f-4263-4187-9812-81705c056f35-1
00:54:52.308 --> 00:54:55.920
most people probably need 8,
some lucky folks need 5.

25b8a706-889a-4e5e-8361-5004f90d9a38-0
00:54:56.320 --> 00:55:00.024
But I think it's important to find your
hours of sleep,

25b8a706-889a-4e5e-8361-5004f90d9a38-1
00:55:00.024 --> 00:55:04.920
correct your cortisol and let everything
heal, calm down and and proceed.

647b2b81-f719-418f-b0a9-1556abcf9d60-0
00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:09.641
And it's down to us to make sure that our
future juniors understand that they're

647b2b81-f719-418f-b0a9-1556abcf9d60-1
00:55:09.641 --> 00:55:13.732
not going to get golden points for being
up all night and then coming and working

647b2b81-f719-418f-b0a9-1556abcf9d60-2
00:55:13.732 --> 00:55:14.680
in the lab with me.

16008ce4-a41b-4083-8014-fd028689724b-0
00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:17.400
You're not a hero and you're not going to
be working in the lab.

835b4d10-0508-4804-9ccc-130b88d9f2d8-0
00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:20.480
You're going to go home,
sleep and come back refreshed.

d1ab06bd-2f2a-4f5f-9620-696dfe955ee1-0
00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:23.000
But it's down to us to change that
culture.

1ba3c113-3aaa-457a-9de1-3e716a780bd1-0
00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:28.319
And it emphasized that being arrested,
good doctor is actually more beneficial

1ba3c113-3aaa-457a-9de1-3e716a780bd1-1
00:55:28.319 --> 00:55:32.400
in the long run in a broken doctor
halfway through their career.

9b0c2555-4c7d-4841-87f1-e38b16b9e861-0
00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:36.889
And that that's,
that's very interesting because when,

9b0c2555-4c7d-4841-87f1-e38b16b9e861-1
00:55:36.889 --> 00:55:41.430
when you mention sleep, when you, if you,
if you look at running related injuries,

9b0c2555-4c7d-4841-87f1-e38b16b9e861-2
00:55:41.430 --> 00:55:44.494
you know, they,
they talk people talk a lot about how I

9b0c2555-4c7d-4841-87f1-e38b16b9e861-3
00:55:44.494 --> 00:55:48.378
have to buy new shoes with more
cushioning and I had need to change my

9b0c2555-4c7d-4841-87f1-e38b16b9e861-4
00:55:48.378 --> 00:55:51.825
running stride, you know,
because I get chin splints and I get

9b0c2555-4c7d-4841-87f1-e38b16b9e861-5
00:55:51.825 --> 00:55:52.920
Achilles tendonitis.

a6ec4d4e-3b10-4a29-b80a-b31e71a8338b-0
00:55:53.560 --> 00:55:54.920
The most effective.

c29b4222-aa6d-473f-af31-1f87988ff088-0
00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:59.887
And this has been shown in studies that
the most effective way to prevent running

c29b4222-aa6d-473f-af31-1f87988ff088-1
00:55:59.887 --> 00:56:00.960
injuries is sleep.

410ff247-0ee6-47fc-b146-a91c95416a6e-0
00:56:01.880 --> 00:56:03.280
Everything else is secondary.

17165ecb-f8be-447a-97b1-c7261443fe5d-0
00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:05.840
If you sleep 8 hours,
you get less injured.

d53b45fa-86f9-47a4-978d-639e51afb326-0
00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:08.480
If you sleep five hours,
you get more injuries.

e7d2eadd-a5a2-4462-8a24-c4e12fb82d62-0
00:56:08.720 --> 00:56:09.920
That, that, that that's how it works.

cc821ed7-10c6-438c-adc9-9991aa8063fa-0
00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:16.621
So sleep builds resilience, you know, to,
to, to a lot of things, you know, as, as,

cc821ed7-10c6-438c-adc9-9991aa8063fa-1
00:56:16.621 --> 00:56:21.328
as we if, if we,
if we like for long procedures, you know,

cc821ed7-10c6-438c-adc9-9991aa8063fa-2
00:56:21.328 --> 00:56:24.200
actual loading everything like that.

0a1f0729-7160-41f0-b4b5-a2acd9cddf9d-0
00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:27.368
Not,
doesn't matter if it comes to training or

0a1f0729-7160-41f0-b4b5-a2acd9cddf9d-1
00:56:27.368 --> 00:56:30.952
if it comes to,
to working or butts off in, in, in the,

0a1f0729-7160-41f0-b4b5-a2acd9cddf9d-2
00:56:30.952 --> 00:56:32.360
in the, in the IR lab.

a0058b74-6701-4858-bd3c-48ec84cd5b51-0
00:56:32.360 --> 00:56:35.759
You know, it's,
it's sleep is is absolutely the most

a0058b74-6701-4858-bd3c-48ec84cd5b51-1
00:56:35.759 --> 00:56:40.120
powerful tool you know for,
for for recovery and injury prevention.

414cd5b6-f71c-4979-9fa6-0e21ddcb0565-0
00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:41.880
That's true.

41bd55d1-a2c9-4cdd-a0dc-377ba3f35d2d-0
00:56:41.880 --> 00:56:42.040
Good.

137ea433-28ba-41c0-aff9-25c6acf6ceea-0
00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:44.880
You may know the answer to this somebody
on the panel.

35c5e062-ce5b-4042-ab28-db02d57b7334-0
00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:49.263
If you wear some of these monitors where
it's one of the either ring or the whoop

35c5e062-ce5b-4042-ab28-db02d57b7334-1
00:56:49.263 --> 00:56:50.600
or the watch or whatever.

68047500-7c40-4b0f-96b5-56158c3aef0d-0
00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:52.640
What do you see?

f7d24d1d-bb08-46bc-9862-aea55602ad4b-0
00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:56.280
Like at the end of a very long day and
you're you're severely fatigued.

27a025d8-b2af-40f2-a899-c48bd761cf5e-0
00:56:56.560 --> 00:57:00.320
Does anybody have an experience with what
parameter changes the most?

6d885c69-ea35-4c8a-8028-c402129e6527-0
00:57:00.320 --> 00:57:05.420
I know probably sleep and sleep wake
cycles or is it heart rate variability or,

6d885c69-ea35-4c8a-8028-c402129e6527-1
00:57:05.420 --> 00:57:10.266
or what, what becomes abnormal after a,
after a long day's work when you're

6d885c69-ea35-4c8a-8028-c402129e6527-2
00:57:10.266 --> 00:57:10.840
fatigued?

5431362f-e5e8-42ac-8696-7cdbd46488cc-0
00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:11.960
Anybody know the answer to that?

9125a37a-97ba-4958-9711-db0dced00f53-0
00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:17.236
Yeah, I'll, I'll say I,
I used a whoop and I think, you know,

9125a37a-97ba-4958-9711-db0dced00f53-1
00:57:17.236 --> 00:57:20.600
we were actually hoping to embed that in,
in ergo caffeine.

6b32ae99-a5e1-4243-8e2e-260001cb3c3e-0
00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:22.840
So I'd say it's an opportunity for us to
study this.

ee532b52-5960-4e9e-8193-c68de37d13d9-0
00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:25.160
We, we,
we should look at this more seriously.

cd7fd033-dd58-4a15-a4d7-4b9baaf0e217-0
00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:27.361
I,
I got the sense in my own anecdotal

cd7fd033-dd58-4a15-a4d7-4b9baaf0e217-1
00:57:27.361 --> 00:57:30.188
experience,
that's probably heart rate variability

cd7fd033-dd58-4a15-a4d7-4b9baaf0e217-2
00:57:30.188 --> 00:57:32.240
that sort of diminished a little bit.

03da2417-ff47-4feb-91bc-737681a63be5-0
00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:36.720
It's certainly fragmentation and sleep is,
is an issue.

5affbd1a-1608-4740-b762-4d33fd4f6d36-0
00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:40.244
And the other comment that I just wanted
to make is that in ergo,

5affbd1a-1608-4740-b762-4d33fd4f6d36-1
00:57:40.244 --> 00:57:43.440
we did a sub study where we looked at
actually nurses and techs.

28510f2e-728c-4e6e-b0e4-559c0631b2df-0
00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:47.760
And so it's just not us as operators,
but the entire environment.

4a420707-b05a-43b1-82c6-d96404cc7186-0
00:57:48.120 --> 00:57:51.907
And in fact,
they had higher rates of being in an high

4a420707-b05a-43b1-82c6-d96404cc7186-1
00:57:51.907 --> 00:57:57.141
risk position at the lumbar position
because they're doing different things

4a420707-b05a-43b1-82c6-d96404cc7186-2
00:57:57.141 --> 00:58:02.720
than we are right there bending down to
grab equipment or looking up to do that.

e390e241-1f25-45a9-9880-2c02c7f8bf97-0
00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:06.161
And,
and just wanted to make a point that it's

e390e241-1f25-45a9-9880-2c02c7f8bf97-1
00:58:06.161 --> 00:58:10.751
critical for us as the physicians,
but also the entire team is affected by a

e390e241-1f25-45a9-9880-2c02c7f8bf97-2
00:58:10.751 --> 00:58:12.480
lot of these factors as well.

2cc755b8-55d2-4649-82f3-27e862c3ee1b-0
00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:16.240
For me, it's the steps.

5747891f-9624-4788-ba84-a39ba5f9ace3-0
00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:21.612
So when I'm in a long day in the lab,
I'm doing less steps because you're kind

5747891f-9624-4788-ba84-a39ba5f9ace3-1
00:58:21.612 --> 00:58:25.080
of in a weird position for a long periods
of time.

069f3c0d-f86b-42ae-8f46-aed859168cca-0
00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:27.320
And it's case after case after case.

e42472ad-ea3f-4a5d-9131-ac6a731e01fe-0
00:58:27.320 --> 00:58:32.237
So especially if you're waiting area and
you consent areas all close by,

e42472ad-ea3f-4a5d-9131-ac6a731e01fe-1
00:58:32.237 --> 00:58:35.000
then I would never reach my 10,000 steps.

cc084fb6-d677-4f1e-8ea2-334320fbc365-0
00:58:35.240 --> 00:58:36.480
So that's the first one.

56d1655e-aa8d-48ca-92e4-e290504429de-0
00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:38.600
And then that has a cascade effect.

817bc806-8141-49a7-a89d-e2729445051d-0
00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:45.720
So I'm moving less, I'm stretching less,
my cortisol's all over the place.

40bcaab2-4fa7-45c1-8f53-08af0999ea5e-0
00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:49.880
I'm certain of it because my cortisol is
related to how many Snicker bars I need.

113a7a8f-0f56-4467-bf65-ad04358508a1-0
00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:54.080
So when I have that easy 5 bars,
no problem.

b03beef2-6c26-43d5-b7c6-64aac6dedd5a-0
00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:59.501
Versus if I was completely away from the
site and I'm sleeping properly,

b03beef2-6c26-43d5-b7c6-64aac6dedd5a-1
00:58:59.501 --> 00:59:02.400
I probably wouldn't even think about
Snickers.

d7b1a9f6-990b-4f4a-9c78-62e49713aea8-0
00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:09.040
So that's, I think for me as a person,
that's how I see it or how I monitor.

0f0d278f-f004-4355-899d-b25a2319dfa0-0
00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:10.640
That's fantastic.

15a6615b-4f7a-418b-9625-77282742c16a-0
00:59:10.640 --> 00:59:12.360
Well, we are a few minutes over.

c74f3234-756a-4791-acd6-fc5c15bfff51-0
00:59:12.840 --> 00:59:14.560
Great to see everyone here.

788806ab-96a5-44e7-8b1c-5deea7697818-0
00:59:14.600 --> 00:59:15.600
Great expertise.

93582bdc-a5bc-4699-a127-ec78fa0b5850-0
00:59:15.640 --> 00:59:16.600
I, I learned a lot.

f60a4959-5cd2-4d6e-bcf4-bc6828ffe52e-0
00:59:17.160 --> 00:59:21.200
Join me now we're going to have a,
